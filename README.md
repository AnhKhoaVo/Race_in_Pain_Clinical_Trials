We first identifed 12,688 clinical trials under "pain" in ACCT. Out of those, 1,433 reported results. The rest of 11,255 clinical trials were then looked over in Pubmed, and out of those, we identified 1,145 publications reported results. Together, the total sample size of clinical trials reported results: 1,433 + 1,145 = 2578. After inclusion criteria: 1,200 is the number of trials we worked with.
