      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug neurotropin in treating chronic pain
      after injury to a limb or a large nerve.

      Two groups of patients will participate in this study: patients with complex regional pain
      syndrome type 1, or CRPS-I (also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy) and patients with
      complex regional pain syndrome type 2, or CRPS-II. CRPS-I is pain that develops after
      relatively minor injury to an arm or leg, but lasts much longer and is much more severe than
      would normally be expected. CRPS-II is pain resulting from injury to a large nerve.
      Candidates will have a history and physical examination, blood tests, and electrocardiogram.
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

      Patients with CRPS I and II will receive an individualized regimen of physical therapy and
      standard treatment to control their pain. In addition, they will receive neurotropin or
      placebo tablets for 5 weeks, then no trial medicine for at least 1 week, and then the other
      trial drug for the next 5 weeks. That is, patients who took placebo the first 5 weeks will
      take neurotropin the second 5 weeks and vice versa. Neither the patients nor the doctors will
      know who received which drug during the two intervals until the study is over. Patients will
      complete questionnaires about their pain, quality of life, and ability to perform daily
      living activities. They will have various tests to measure pain (such as sensitivity to heat
      and cold, to an electric current, to a mild pin prick, etc.); to provide information about
      changes in their condition (such as tests of range of motion of joints and limb size); to
      measure blood circulation and sweating in the arm or leg (such as measurements of blood flow
      to the limb, skin temperature, and sweat production), and other procedures.

      Percutaneous large core image-guided breast biopsy is a well established tool in diagnosing
      breast cancer, but the associated anxiety and pain can tax the coping mechanism of even well
      functioning individuals. Unabated stress during an invasive procedure not only interferes
      with smooth progression of the ongoing procedure, but can also have deleterious effects when
      patients need additional procedures and dread recurrent medical traumatization. The long-term
      objective of this research is to provide patients with a simple coping strategy at the
      vulnerable time of large core biopsy in the hope that this behavioral intervention will carry
      over to recovery and future medical procedures. In the largest prospective randomized study
      of its kind, the researchers showed that a self-hypnotic intervention during percutaneous,
      image-guided vascular and renal interventions resulted in less pain and anxiety, greater
      hemodynamic stability, and fewer procedure interruptions. The positive effects of the short
      initial hypnotic intervention, which was structured in the procedure room, became more
      pronounced the longer the procedure lasted and carried over into the immediate post-procedure
      recovery. The investigators therefore challenge the current paradigms that long-lasting
      effects require intensive presurgical preparation.

      Patients with interstitial cystitis have been well documented to have pelvic floor muscle
      tenderness as well as pain on bladder distension. Some investigators have even suggested that
      pelvic floor muscle pain is primarily the cause of bladder problems.

      Botulinum toxin A causes muscle relaxation by inhibiting the acetylcholine release at the
      neuromuscular junction. It has been shown that this mechanism relieves pain in a number of
      muscle spasm-related syndromes.

      Because, at present, there is little effective therapy available for patients with
      interstitial cystitis, the researchers want to determine if botulinum toxin A will relieve
      bladder and pelvic pain in these patients.

      but are not limited to, over-the-counter medications, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs,
      Physical Therapy, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and nerve blocks.
      Historically, the mainstay of pain treatment has been pharmacotherapy. However,
      pharmacotherapy has varying degrees of effectiveness and is often associated with undesirable
      side effects. Although many patients are successfully treated, for those who fail some of
      these more conservative therapies the remaining option is limited to spinal cord stimulation
      (SCS), proven to be an effective therapy to more than half of those failing conservative
      treatments . Over 50% of those who have failed these more conservative methods of pain
      management, can now, under the guidance of a clinician utilizing SCS, have their pain levels
      successfully managed. SCS is a less invasive therapy that is a reversible treatment with
      greater long-term benefits than more permanent, radical approaches and one that deserves
      greater consideration in the management of chronic, intractable pain.

      An estimate of 90% of patients with cancer experience at least moderate pain at some point in

      this research is to reduce barriers to pain control by creating more effective partnerships
      between patients and their health care providers. The aims of the study are: 1) to compare
      the effects on pain, cancer-related symptoms, and health-related quality of life of a
      standard cancer pain leaflet versus face-to-face, tailored education and coaching; 2) to
      estimate the effect of tailored education and coaching on patients' self confidence for
      managing their pain and participating actively in care; and 3) to examine the mechanisms
      underlying the beneficial effects of the intervention. The proposed model will enhance
      research on pain management in that it is a pilot-tested intervention that is applicable in
      the outpatient setting, based on Social Cognitive Theory, and focused on patient activation
      and education.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BEMA fentanyl at any dose in the
      management of breakthrough pain in cancer subjects on background opioid therapy. The standard
      of care for these breakthrough pain episodes is a rapid onset, short acting analgesic with
      minimal associated sleepiness. Oral morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone are routinely used,
      but because of slow and variable oral absorption, the pain control is not the best with these
      products. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) has been used successfully in treating
      breakthrough pain episodes associated with cancer. OTFC is a lozenge of fentanyl on a stick
      and is administered by continuously swabbing the interior of the subject's mouth until the
      product is dissolved (approximately 15 to 30 minutes). The buccal route of administration
      avoids the delay and variability associated with oral absorption.

      BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI) has developed BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive)
      fentanyl, an alternative product to OTFC that does not require the subject to continuously
      paint the inside of the mouth with the dosage form. The BDSI product is a small disc that is
      placed against the mucosal membrane inside the mouth. The mucoadhesive polymers in the disc
      readily adhere to the mucosal membrane (within 5 seconds) when moistened. The components of
      the disc are water soluble, so the entire dosage form dissolves within 30 minutes of
      application.

      As clinicians, it is often a struggle to find effective pain control for a certain subgroup
      of patients with tetraplegia. These patients often have severe upper back, neck, and shoulder
      pain, limiting rehabilitation productivity and potential, and always limiting quality of
      life.

      This pain appears to be primarily musculoskeletal. Muscles in the upper back and neck become
      shortened, rock hard, and extremely tender with even the slightest touch or stretch.
      Refractory to multiple classes of medications, modalities, and other treatments, patients
      truly suffer-not only from pain, but from fatigue, sedation, expense, and loss of useful
      rehabilitation time due to attempted remedies. Unfortunately, this subgroup of patients is
      not small and the problem is significant, as anyone who specializes in the treatment of
      spinal cord injury patients will recognize.

      In search for another form of treatment, botulinum toxin A (BTXA) may be promising for pain
      control in that group of patients with tetraplegia whose pain has proven to be refractory to
      treatment. It did not take long searching the literature to find compelling evidence that
      BTXA may have another mechanism of action for direct pain control, apart from its well known
      mechanism for spasticity control. Clinically, it is increasingly being recommended and used
      for this purpose. In fact, one of the specific indications now recognized by most for BTXA
      treatment is for myogenic pain due to short, tight, strained muscles-just as we see with our
      population. Yet, it's application has not been studied in people with tetraplegia. Thus, the
      genesis of the project and the hope to help our patients evolved.

      Study hypotheses:

        -  In addition to traditional treatments used for pain control, injection of BTXA into
           cervical and upper back muscles will effectively reduce cervical/shoulder pain severity
           reported by individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries, regardless of the etiology
           of pain.

        -  Pain reduction secondary to the use of BTXA will be associated with a decrease in total
           analgesic medication use among SCI patients during acute inpatient rehabilitation.

        -  BTXA to treat cervical/shoulder pain will increase active participation in the
           rehabilitation program for individuals with tetraplegia during inpatient rehabilitation.

      Naturally occurring opiates (endorphins) decrease testosterone levels by inhibiting the
      synthesis of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and also inhibiting testosterone synthesis
      by the testes. Similarly, men with addiction to narcotics and those on exogenous opioids for
      pain control have decreased serum testosterone levels. Indeed, these men complain of
      decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and impaired quality of life. Animal studies have
      shown that gonadectomy results in a decrease in pain threshold in rats and repletion of
      testosterone elevates that threshold. These observations suggest that testosterone may
      possess analgesic properties. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that hypogonadism
      developing in men on opioids results in an increased sensitivity to pain and requirement of
      higher doses of opioids. In this study, the investigators plan to administer testosterone to
      men with opioid-induced hypogonadism and evaluate their pain perception, pain sensitivity in
      response to noxious stimuli and changes in the requirement of opioids in response to
      testosterone administration.

      Hypothesis:

      Testosterone replacement in men with opioid-induced hypogonadism will improve pain tolerance,
      pain perception and quality of life.

      Specific aims:

        1. To evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement on pain sensitivity, pain tolerance,
           and pain modulation in men with opioid-induced hypogonadism.

        2. To determine the effects of testosterone replacement on health-related quality of life.

        3. To determine whether testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men induces changes in the
           dosage requirements of opioid medications for pain control.

      To accomplish our specific aims, the investigators propose a randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel arm study in which hypogonadal men with non-cancer chronic back
      pain syndrome on chronic opioids and low testosterone levels (<300 ng/dl) will be randomized
      to exogenous testosterone replacement therapy vs placebo. Our primary outcome is change in
      pain tolerance using various external painful stimuli. Secondary outcomes are change in pain
      sensitivity and modulation, quality of life and opioid requirements.

      Primary Total Knee joint replacement surgery is highly successful surgery for relieving pain
      and improving function in patients with disabling arthritis. Unfortunately, like all
      biomedical devices, prosthesis failure is a complication of knee replacement surgery that
      leads to disabling pain, stiffness and loss of function. Approximately 1% of the knee
      replacements fail every year leading to a 20% failure rate over 20 years. The common causes
      of failure of prosthetic joint are infection, loosening, trauma or wear of the prosthesis.
      Currently, a revision surgery is the best option for long term pain relief (analgesics or
      other pain medications are options but are of limited benefit). Surgery may not be feasible
      in patients due to advancing age, other medical conditions and surgical/technical
      difficulties or patient's choice. In addition, the results from revision surgery are not as
      good as the initial knee joint surgery. Therefore, there is a great need for a novel,
      targeted therapy that provides an option to patients who are unfit, unable, or unwilling to
      undergo surgery.

      In the investigators' recent pilot study, a single injection of Botulinum toxin A (Botox) in
      painful natural knee, ankle and shoulder joints of patients with various types of arthritis
      led to significant and durable improvement in pain and function and was safe to use. The
      investigators propose this 6-month study to compare pain relief, improvement of function and
      safety of an injection of Botulinum toxin compared to placebo in patients with a painful
      prosthetic knee joint. Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the treatment
      assignment to a patient until the study is completed. The investigators will assess the
      amount and duration of pain relief, improvement in function and short term safety of
      Botulinum toxin using standard validated measures. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 2
      weeks, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-months after a single injection of either placebo or BoNT/A in
      the hip or knee prosthesis. The six-month follow-up is to assess the duration of meaningful
      pain relief. If successful, this will offer a new treatment option for patients with a
      chronically painful knee prosthetic joint, provide more insight into the origin and cause of
      pain in prosthetic joints and direct future investigations in new directions.

      Studies suggest that administration of maintenance epidural solutions as programmed or
      automated intermittent boluses, rather than continuous infusions, result in lower bupivacaine
      consumption, decreased need for manual boluses by the anesthesiologist, and greater patient
      satisfaction. In this technique, the epidural maintenance dose is administered as a bolus by
      the infusion pump at regular intervals instead of as a continuous infusion. However, the
      optimal combination of bolus volume and dosing interval has not been determined. At one end
      of the spectrum, a small volume and short bolus dose interval will likely behave like a
      continuous infusion. At the other end of the spectrum, a large volume and long bolus dose
      interval may lead to an increased incidence of breakthrough pain. The purpose of this
      randomized, double-blind trial was to determine how manipulation of the programmed
      intermittent time interval and volume influences total drug use, quality of analgesia, and
      patient satisfaction during maintenance of labor analgesia. We hypothesized that manipulation
      of the programmed intermittent bolus time interval and volume during the maintenance of
      epidural labor analgesia influences total drug use, quality of analgesia and patient
      satisfaction.

      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common knee disorder affecting physically active
      people. Despite the growing base of support for the early introduction of hip strengthening
      exercises into the rehabilitation of PFPS, there have been few randomized clinical trials
      comparing isolated hip to isolated quadriceps strengthening. The purpose of this study is to
      determine how different exercises affect pain, strength, muscle activity, and function in
      female subjects with patellofemoral pain. The researchers hypothesize that females diagnosed
      with PFPS who initially participate in a hip strengthening program will report a greater
      perceived level of function, greater strength, less pain, and improved neuromuscular activity
      than those who participate in a progressive quadriceps strengthening intervention.

      Lumbar zygapophysial (facet) joint pain is a common cause of low back pain. Radiofrequency
      (RF) denervation is an effective and low risk treatment of chronic low back pain of suspected
      facet joint etiology. Blocks of the medial branches innervating the joints are commonly used
      to localize the pain and make the diagnosis of facet joint pain.

      There is currently no standard number of diagnostic blocks: zero, one, and two blocks have
      all been utilized. Considering the high false positive and false negative rates of these
      blocks, the cost: benefit ratio has been questioned. No study to date has examined the
      practice of diagnostic medial branch blocks before RF denervation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal number of blocks before radiofrequency
      denervation. Three groups of patients will be studied. In group I, patients will undergo RF
      denervation based on history and physical exam alone. In group II, patients will undergo RF
      denervation based on a positive response to a single diagnostic block with local anesthetic.
      In group III, patients will undergo RF treatment only after a positive screening block and a
      positive confirmatory block.

      Recently a clinical prediction rule (CPR) has been developed that identifies patients with
      neck pain who are likely to respond rapidly and dramatically to thoracic spine thrust
      manipulation and an active range of motion exercise. Although the initial predictor variables
      identified during the development of a thoracic spine manipulation CPR seem to have adequate
      face validity, there is no guarantee that these factors will persist in a different group of
      patients, even ones with similar characteristics as those used in the initial exploratory
      study. The purpose of this follow-up study in which patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive thoracic spine thrust manipulation followed by therapeutic exercises or therapeutic
      exercise alone will be to investigate the validity of the previously developed CPR. If the
      CPR is indeed meaningful, patients who are positive on the CPR and receive thoracic spine
      thrust manipulation should experience improved outcomes compared to patients who are negative
      on the CPR and receive thoracic spine manipulation, and compared to patients who are positive
      on the CPR but receive the intervention believed to be effective for another subgroup of
      patients with neck pain.

      After Laparoscopic surgery most patients experience some form of mild to moderate pain. The
      current standard of care is to treat this pain with local anesthetics (numbing medication,
      that deadens the nerve endings) to the small surgical incisions (cuts) and narcotic systemic
      analgesics (medication injected into your vein to control pain such as morphine).

      Although this treatment improves pain symptoms it is not perfect. Firstly, complete pain
      control is rarely achieved and secondly, narcotics (such as morphine) often have many side
      effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation (sleepiness), constipation and abdominal upset.
      All of these issues make recovery less comfortable and delays return to full function (work,
      school and other activities of daily life).

      A new FDA approved device is now available that offers the benefits of long term anesthesia
      without the side effects of narcotics. It consists of a pump that continuously infuses local
      anesthesia into and around the surgical site. This pump is placed during your operation. You
      then carry a tennis ball sized container made of soft plastic in a pouch which drips numbing
      medicine around your wounds for 2 days continuously.

      The purpose of this study is to see if this pump improves postoperative pain, decreases the
      need for narcotic pain medicine and allows people to return to their activities earlier.

      This study proposes to compare two innovative treatment approaches for LBP, both of which
      focus on delivering individualized care through evidence-based, clinical care pathways.

      The primary aim of the project is to determine the relative clinical efficacy of 1)
      chiropractic care and 2) multidisciplinary, integrative care in 200 patients with sub-acute
      or chronic LBP, in both the short-term (after 12 weeks) and long-term (after 52 weeks). The
      primary outcome measure in this study is patient-rated back pain.

      Chiropractic care will include therapies within the professional scope of practice.
      Integrative, multidisciplinary care will include chiropractic, massage therapy, traditional
      Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise,
      and patient education.

      Secondary aims are to assess between group differences in frequency of symptoms, disability,
      fear avoidance behavior, self efficacy, general health, improvement, patient satisfaction,
      work loss, medication use, lumbar dynamic motion, and torso muscle endurance. Patients' and
      providers' perceptions of treatment will be described using qualitative methods and
      cost-effectiveness and cost utility will be assessed in the short- and long-term.

      This innovative study is an exciting collaboration between an experienced and established
      team of chiropractic, conventional, and CAM professionals dedicated to advancing the care of
      pervasive and costly LBP conditions. This trial will provide new and important information
      for all health care providers and LBP patients, informing decision making and improving care
      delivery systems.

      Some of the children who suffer acute burn injury do not have adequate pain and anxiety
      management with the current regimen of scheduled opiates (morphine) and benzodiazepines
      (lorazepam). Other children have significant side effects or contraindications, such as
      constipation or over sedation, when taking these medications. Clonidine is known to reduce
      the need for morphine in the management of postoperative pain. The addition of clonidine to
      the pharmacological treatment of burn wound pain offers a possible adjunct to the standard
      opiate and benzodiazepines regimen. Clonidine has been used in children in both on a
      short-term basis (such as postoperative pain management) and on a long-term basis (such as
      the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)). This study tests the
      hypothesis that clonidine in a dose of 5 ug/kilo every 8 hours will be a useful adjunct to
      the management of pain and anxiety in the acutely burned child. All children will be treated
      by protocol with morphine (0.03mg/kilo) q4hr prn pain and lorazepam (0.03 mg/kilo) q 4 hours
      prn anxiety. In addition, after informed consent is obtained the children will be randomized
      to the addition clonidine or placebo. Pain and anxiety will be assessed using standard
      instruments blind to the medication being used on a daily basis Also the total dose of
      morphine and lorazepam during the 10 days of added clonidine or placebo will be recorded..
      The pain rating, anxiety ratings, total morphine dose, and total lorazepam dose will be
      compared between the placebo and clonidine groups with a Student's t test. Once the blind is
      broken the child will be allowed to remain on the clonidine if it is beneficial. The second
      year of the grant will expand the age groups down to younger children and also begin to gain
      information about the effect of clonidine on the hypermetabolic state secondary to burn
      injury.

      This is a double-blinded study of subacromial corticosteroid injection (steroid injection to
      the shoulder) to treat shoulder pain in the paralyzed (hemiplegic) shoulder of chronic stroke
      survivors. This study is designed to evaluate pain relief of a standard steroid injection
      treatment, compared to a high dose treatment and a low dose treatment, for shoulder pain in
      stroke survivors. A total of 105 chronic stroke survivors with moderate to severe shoulder
      pain will be enrolled. All eligible participants will undergo an initial test injection to
      localize pain to the subacromial space. If this turns out to be positive, the subjects will
      be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

        1. low dose group which receives 20mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder;

        2. standard dose group which receives a standard 40mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection
           to the subacromial space of the affected shoulder; or

        3. high dose group which receives 60mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder.

      Study participants will all rate their pain in interviews (Baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12
      (7 times) and in laboratory-based measures that will be administered at baseline, weeks 4, 8,

      Cervical facet arthropathy is a common cause of chronic neck pain. The ""gold standard"" for
      diagnosis is either blocking the facet joints, or more commonly blocking the medial branch
      nerves that innervate the joints. However, many studies have found a high false-positive rate
      when the nerves are blocked using 0.5 ml of local anesthetic. We will randomize patients to
      receive either cervical facet medial branch blocks with 0.25 ml of local anesthetic and
      contrast, or 0.5 ml. We will then do a CT scan to determine the accuracy and specificity of
      each block. Our hypothesis is that using the higher volume (0.5 ml) might be responsible for
      the high false-positive rate.

      The investigators primary objective is to study the analgesic effects of combined ketorolac
      and lidocaine in a paracervical block compared to preoperative ibuprofen followed by
      intra-operative paracervical block with lidocaine alone on women undergoing first trimester
      surgical abortions. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive a paracervical block
      of combined ketorolac and lidocaine will experience less pain during the procedure based on a
      visual analog scale (VAS) compared to those who receive preoperative ibuprofen and a
      paracervical block with lidocaine alone.

      This randomized, multi-site, placebo-controlled clinical trial will investigate the
      difference in perceived pain from first trimester surgical abortions using a paracervical
      block of combined ketorolac and lidocaine compared to preoperative ibuprofen and paracervical
      block with lidocaine alone. A total of fifty women who are seeking elective surgical
      abortions of intrauterine pregnancies less than 11 0/7 weeks' gestation will be recruited
      from Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Planned Parenthood of Maryland in Baltimore,
      Maryland and Planned Parenthood Columbia-Willamette in Portland, Oregon. Pain before, during,
      and after surgical abortion will be measured using a 100-mm VAS.

      The primary outcome of interest is the mean difference in pain level from preoperative
      baseline to time after cervical dilation comparing the treatment groups. If the investigators
      see greater pain reduction associated with the paracervical block of lidocaine and ketorolac,
      adoption of this regimen may improve pain management during first trimester surgical
      abortions. If combined ketorolac and lidocaine when administered as a paracervical block is
      proven to be efficacious, the need for additional analgesia in first trimester surgical
      abortions can be minimized.

      Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) is an extremely pervasive childhood condition and, like IBS in
      adults, it is one of the functional bowel disorders without a clear framework of
      understanding or an effective treatment. However, new research suggests that small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may be the unifying pathophysiology that explains the variety of
      symptoms experienced by patients with IBS. As CAP in children is believed to be a precursor
      to IBS in adults, we hypothesize that children with this disorder have a significantly
      greater prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) than normal, healthy
      children, and that eradication of bacterial overgrowth with antibiotics will reduce symptoms
      of chronic abdominal pain in children with this condition. To prove this, we will first aim
      to determine the prevalence of SIBO in both healthy children and those with CAP. We will do
      this by performing a lactulose breath hydrogen test, the gold standard for the noninvasive
      measurement of SIBO, on 40 healthy controls and 80 subjects with CAP. We will then assess
      whether eradication of SIBO with antibiotics will reduce symptoms of chronic abdominal pain
      in children with this condition. To do this we will randomize, in a double-blinded fashion,
      the 80 CAP patients to receive a 10-day course of either the antibiotic Rifaximin or a
      placebo. After completion of the treatment we will evaluate all these patients for
      eradication of bacterial overgrowth by repeating a lactulose breath hydrogen test. We will
      also assess for symptom improvement by re-administering questionnaires.

      After surgery it is normal to experience some pain at the site of operation. In order to
      reduce the pain, medication such as Morphine is injected into a vein using a Patient
      Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump that is kept at bed side, and is activated by the patient
      when needed. However, Morphine is an opioid drug, which can cause side effects such as
      sedation, nausea, vomiting, and reduced breathing on prolonged use. In addition to the opioid
      drugs, local anesthetics, and other drugs called Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) have been injected locally to provide prolonged pain relief without the side effects
      of morphine. Recently a portable device called ON-Q pump has been developed to continuously
      infuse the local anesthetic through 2 small catheters inserted at the wound site. The ON-Q
      Pump is a small tennis ball sized unit made of a soft synthetic material that slowly infuses
      the drug through the catheters by elastic force. This pump is very safe and is attached to a
      bedside pole or the patient's hospital gown. This pump has already been approved by the FDA
      for clinical use, and has been reported to provide effective pain management after some
      surgical procedures.

      The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the relative efficacy of the drugs
      Ketorolac and Ropivacaine infused through the ON-Q pump in reducing the pain following
      gynecologic surgery. Ketorolac and Ropivacaine are approved drugs that are frequently used
      for post operative pain relief. Our hypothesis is that these two drugs in combination will
      provide better analgesia than Ketorolac alone.

      We wish to examine the safety and speed of onset of giving a dose of 1mg hydromorphone
      followed by an additional 1mg. Eligible patients will be given 1 mg intravenous (IV)
      hydromorphone. At 15 minutes, these patients will be asked the question, ""Do you need more
      pain medication?"" Those that answer ""yes"" will receive an additional 1mg IV hydromorphone.
      Those that answer ""no"" will not receive additional pain medications at that time period (15

      we believe will result in less incidence of oxygen desaturation.

      which if unrelieved may result in prolonged hospital stay, inability to participate in
      rehabilitation programs, poor outcomes, and greater use of health-care resources. This study
      examines the effect of pregabalin administered for TKA on pain-related neurotransmitter

      This study will examine hormone function in men with osteoarthritis pain and how it is
      affected by opioid medication (such as Percocet, Vicodin, MS Contin and morphine) versus
      placebo.

      Men between 30 and 65 years of age who have had moderate to severe osteoarthritis joint pain
      at least 5 days a week over the past 3 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a physical examination, x-rays, laboratory and other tests, and questionnaires
      about pain, mood and medical health. They are given a pain diary to complete for 2 weeks.

      Participants are admitted to the hospital for two 12 hour overnight stays, during each of
      which they provide a 24-hour urine collection and have a small blood sample drawn every 20
      minutes for 12 hours (from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.) through a catheter that remains in place
      in a vein. Blood pressure and pulse are monitored during this time. After the catheter is
      removed, subjects complete questionnaires about their pain, mood and activity.

      For the several weeks between the two hospitalizations, subjects take either an opioid
      medication or placebo, or standard medication such as motrin and naprosyn, according to
      random assignment to one of the three groups. All participants will be allowed to take
      anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen during this time as needed, but no other pain
      medications or treatments. They are monitored two or three times a week by telephone and
      complete a pain diary.

      After the second hospitalization, subjects are tapered off the study medication. After 2 to 4
      weeks of stopping medication, they return for a final outpatient visit to review pain or
      other medical problems and to have blood drawn.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard medical therapy versus
      usual care in women with chest pain, coronary endothelial dysfunction and unblocked coronary
      arteries.

      Coronary endothelial dysfunction (CED) is a condition in which the layers of cells around the
      heart do not function properly and is believed to be key factor in the development of
      atherosclerosis (fat deposits in arteries). In addition, CED is associated with an increased
      risk for future cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke.

      A coronary angiogram allows physicians to see if any of the arteries in the heart are
      blocked, usually by fatty plaque. In many instances, angiograms in women experiencing chest
      pain do not show evidence of coronary disease (free of significant plaque build-up).
      Currently, there is no standard of care treatment plan for patients with normal coronary
      arteries, despite symptoms of chest pain, and as a result these patients may not receive
      medical treatment. However, these women often return to their physicians more than once with
      chest pain and go through a similar battery of tests.

      Each patient was assigned to one of the two groups: IDB or Sham. On the day of the procedure,
      an IV was inserted in pre-procedural area and patient transported to the procedure room. The
      procedure will be completed under fluoroscopy in prone position. Patients were given 1-4 mg
      of midazolam for relaxation before the procedure and, if needed, 50-100 mcg of fentanyl IV
      during the procedure. The patients was randomly assigned to treatment or placebo using
      computer-generated codes maintained in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The physician
      performing procedure was informed of the assignment. In IDB group, guided by the fluoroscopic
      imaging, two transdiscal probes was positioned in the posterior annulus using a
      posterolateral, oblique approach. First, two electrically insulated 17G transdiscal
      introducers was used to gain an access to the disc space. Than, two radiofrequency probes
      will be positioned through each of the introducers bilaterally to create a bipolar
      configuration. Placement of the transdiscal probes within the disc annulus will be confirmed
      using oblique, lateral, and anterior-posterior fluoroscopic images. Sham group had their
      introducers and electrodes positioned just outside of the disc. This was also be documented
      using fluoroscopy. Investigator attached the electrodes to inactive heater control device
      that provide a similar auditory and visual experience for the patient. Patients were
      therefore remain blinded to actual treatment and physician performing procedure was not
      involved in patient's follow-up. Patients were awake and communicating with the physician
      conducting the procedure and if pain in legs were present and increased during the procedure,
      the heating protocol would be stopped. Following completion of procedure the patient was
      transferred to recovery and monitored for 45 minutes, then discharged home with instructions.

      Awkward postures during computer keyboard use have been hypothesized to be one cause of
      musculoskeletal pain/discomfort as well as musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity
      (MSD-UE). Alternative computer keyboards purport to reduce musculoskeletal pain/discomfort
      and have been shown to change aspects of keyboard users' kinematics under laboratory
      conditions. However, research that has examined the effectiveness of alternative keyboards in
      reducing musculoskeletal pain/discomfort in the workplace is equivocal, and no study has
      examined the association between postures and musculoskeletal pain. The Aims of this 3-year
      prospective double cross-over trial are: 1) To examine the effectiveness of an alternative
      keyboard in reducing reports of pain over 6-months; 2) To examine the neutrality and
      stability of postures during keyboard use; and 3) To identify which postures are associated
      with lower levels of musculoskeletal pain. Seventy-five computer users will be randomly
      assigned to one of two keyboard use orders: Group 1 - AB (standard keyboard, alternative
      keyboard); Group 2 - BA (alternative keyboard, standard keyboard). All subjects will use
      their assigned keyboards for 6-months before switching to the next keyboard. Every week,
      subjects will report their musculoskeletal pain levels. Just prior to and just after each
      6-month intervention subjects' kinematics performances on the keyboards will be recorded at
      the worksite using the Keyboard - Personal Computing Style (K-PeCS) instrument and in a
      laboratory setting using 3-dimensional motion capture technology.

      Aim 1: To examine the effectiveness of an alternative keyboard in reducing pain over
      6-months.

      Hypothesis 1 (H-1) - At six months subjects using an alternative keyboard will have
      significantly lower musculoskeletal pain levels than when using a standard keyboard.

      Aim 2: To examine the neutrality and stability of postures during keyboard use.

      Hypothesis 3 (H-2) - Subjects using an alternative keyboard will have significantly more
      neutral postures than when using a standard keyboard at baseline and at 6 months Hypothesis 3
      (H-3) - Subjects 6-months keyboarding postures will remain equivalent to the keyboarding
      postures documented at baseline.

      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed operations in young men.
      Persistent pain after inguinal surgery represents a significant cause of disability,
      occurring in between 15%-35% of cases. In a majority of these patients, their groin pain
      persisted after a previous hernia repair. The main type of chronic postsurgical pain is
      neuropathic, caused by injured nerves. One of the principal components in the pathophysiology
      of postsurgical pain is cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In animal
      studies, injecting TNF inhibitors before nerve injury can reduce pain behaviors and
      neuropathology. Finding a way to reduce the incidence of postsurgical pain after hernia
      repair could enhance function, and reduce the need for opioids and other analgesics. The
      investigators intend to conduct the first randomized, controlled study evaluating whether
      preemptive administration of a tumor necrosis inhibitor can reduce postoperative pain and
      opioid consumption after hernia repair. This is important because the degree and intensity of
      postsurgical pain is a major predictor for the development of chronic postsurgical pain.

      than depressed patients without pain. While psychotherapy treatment studies have demonstrated
      improvement in pain and depression, no psychosocial interventions have been developed and

      Noxious stimuli occurring intraoperatively and postoperatively generate central
      sensitization, decreasing pain thresholds and ultimately increasing analgesic requirements.
      The pathophysiology of central sensitization is thought to involve excitatory amino acid
      receptors such as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (1, 2). Ketamine is a N-methyl-d-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to be useful in the reduction of acute
      postoperative pain and analgesic consumption in a variety of surgical interventions (3).

      Spine surgery provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the preemptive and preventative
      impact of ketamine on the primary end points of postoperative 24 and 48 hour opioid
      consumption in patients with chronic pain. The goal of this double blinded, prospective,
      randomized placebo controlled trial is to quantify the preemptive and preventative analgesic
      effects of ketamine infusions in this patient population. Such insight may lead to better
      pain control, improved satisfaction, and ultimately a reduction in side-effects related to
      postoperative opioid use.

      Pain is the most common physical symptom in primary care, accounting for an enormous burden
      in terms of patient suffering, quality of life, work and social disability, and health care
      and societal costs. Pain is particularly prevalent among veterans. Four major barriers to
      optimal care include underdetection of pain, inadequate initial treatment, failure to monitor
      adherence and symptom response, and failure to adjust treatment in patients not responding or
      intolerant of initial therapy. Therefore, we propose to conduct the Stepped Care to Optimize
      Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study, a randomized clinical effectiveness trial in primary
      care.

      Patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer often experience co-occuring pain, fatigue,
      and sleep disturbance that are not relieved with medications. Brief cognitive-behavioral
      coping strategies such as relaxation or imagery have been shown to be useful for these
      symptoms individually and may be effective for the cluster of co-occuring pain, fatigue, and
      sleep disturbance. Because single cognitive-behavioral strategies don't work equally well for
      all persons, providing training in multiple cognitive-behavioral strategies is necessary.
      However, oncology nurses report having insufficient time and are often not available to
      deliver the interventions exactly when patients experience symptom exacerbation. This
      application proposes a patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral (PC-CB) intervention, using an
      MP3 player to deliver recorded cognitive-behavioral strategies. The PC-CB intervention would
      allow patients to select from a variety of cognitive-behavioral strategies based on their
      personal preferences, and facilitate self-administration of those strategies at whatever time

      Purpose: To compare the efficacy of oral gabapentin and its newer analogue pregabalin in
      postoperative pain control after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

      Methods: One hundred and four patients who meet the inclusion criteria undergoing PRK in one
      or both eyes will be randomized into one of two treatment groups. Those in group A will be
      treated with gabapentin, and those in group B will be treated with pregabalin to control
      postoperative PRK pain. Patients in both groups will begin treatment two hours prior to
      surgery in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels of each medication. After surgery the
      patients will assess their pain level using the visual analogue scale (VAS) at different
      intervals of time - one hour after surgery, the evening of the surgery, and three times each
      day for three subsequent days. Patients will also daily assess their level of somnolence
      using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and record the presence of dizziness for the same
      amount of time. On the fourth day they will return to clinic for a postoperative appointment.
      At that time the pain, sleepiness, and dizziness assessment scales will be collected and
      analyzed. The patients will return one month later to further assess long-term pain and
      healing after PRK.

      Results: Both gabapentin and pregabalin have been shown in previous studies to treat
      postoperative pain effectively. The effects of gabapentin 300 mg TID for 3 days versus
      pregabalin 50 mg TID for 3 days on decreasing overall postoperative pain following PRK will
      be presented.

      Conclusion: The effectiveness of the two different treatment medications will be analyzed,
      and the conclusion will be based on the results.

      Based on available mechanistic and clinical information, the investigators propose a
      nonrandomized study to evaluate the effect of succinylcholine in patients taking statins. The
      investigators' purpose is to evaluate the effect of succinylcholine on patients taking
      statins. Patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery (other then orthopedic, spinal,
      vascular or muscle) with planned endotracheal intubation will be approached regarding
      participation in the trial. Design of the study is complex because there is no way to
      randomize patients to statins or no statins and also no way to take them off the statins
      prior surgery. So statin use will not be randomized; confounding factors will be accounted
      for by stratification (every 10 years of age from 40-80 and gender) and statistical
      adjustment. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that succinylcholine
      administration increases plasma myoglobin concentration more in patients who are on statins
      compared to patients who do not.

      Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) prevents the release of acetylcholine in presynaptic terminals of
      the neuromuscular junction. It has been proposed to be effective in spastic conditions of the
      head and neck including oromandibular dystonias, bruxism, and muscular hypertrophy (1,2,3,4).
      However, only one randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial has been completed
      involving 20 patients demonstrating both objective and subjective improvement in the BTX-A
      treated group over those treated with saline at one week, one month, and six months (5).

      Currently, in most orofacial pain practices, when the diagnosis of masticatory myofascial
      pain in the head region is made, patients are treated with a standard myofascial protocol.
      This protocol involves stretching, application of moist heat, spray and stretch, and
      lidocaine trigger point injections into the masticatory muscles. This is considered the
      standard of care among most orofacial pain practioners.

      There have been no randomized, double-blinded, head-to-head trials comparing BTX-A injections
      to lidocaine injections in the treatment of masticatory myofacial pain. Moreover, in all
      studies, muscles were targeted using surface landmarks with no confirmatory tests to
      guarantee the medication was administered to the intended muscle. In previous studies, the
      medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, important masticatory muscles that is often hyperactive
      in masticatory myofacial pain was not injected due to lack of palpable surface landmarks.
      Ultrasound and electromyography (EMG) guidance will help us locate these muscles.

      The purpose of this study is to objectively measure functional improvement in patients with
      masticatory myofascial pain injected with lidocaine versus BTX-A. A pilot study enrolling 20
      patients is proposed. 20 patients will be randomized to receive either BTX-A or lidocaine
      injections into the bilateral temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoid.
      Objective and subjective clinical parameters will be measured. These include pain at rest and
      with chewing, maximum non-assisted and assisted mouth opening, protrusive and laterotrusive
      jaw movements, subjective efficacy of treatment, and side-effects of treatment. Patients will
      be assessed at baseline, one week, one month, and three months after the procedure.

      the end of their visit. The provider will also assess and record the subject's pain
      experienced during the procedure. The investigators will also measure preoperative and
      postoperative vital signs on all participants. Subjects will be compensated for their time
      and study participation will not affect any care received at the clinic. Upon completion of

      The proposed study will test how well an innovative method, interactive voice response (IVR),
      can be used for delivering an treatment for chronic low back pain. The use of IVR will
      improve the accessibility of treatment to Veterans. IVR is a computerized interface that
      allows patients to use their telephone to: 1) obtain pre-recorded didactic information, 2)
      report data regarding pain-related symptoms and adherence to pain coping skill practice, and
      3) receive personalized therapist feedback. Although CBT has been shown to be effective in
      reducing pain intensity, traditional CBT requires patients to make frequent office visits.
      The use of IVR will allow Veterans to access CBT from their home via a touch-tone telephone,
      thereby allowing them to access treatment at their convenience without travel to the VA for
      an outpatient appointment. Veterans with chronic low back pain will be randomized in equal
      numbers to receive either standard CBT or IVR-based CBT. Veterans in both conditions will
      receive 10 session of treatment designed to help them manage their chronic pain using pain
      coping skills. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity.

      Sore throat is a common postoperative complaint that can lead to morbidity and patient
      dissatisfaction . The incidence of sore throat has been reported to be between 6% and 90%
      even under optimal intubating conditions. There are several factors that have been shown to
      contribute to postoperative sore throat such as patient related factors, type of anesthesia
      and type of surgery.

      Corticosteroids are also commonly used in the perioperative period to potentiate analgesics
      and as antiemetics. The preoperative administration of dexamethasone can decrease the
      incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat which is rated by patients as one of the
      most undesirable outcomes in the postoperative period.

      The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block involves the sensory nerve supply of the anterior
      -lateral abdominal wall where the T7-12 intercostal nerves, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and
      the lateral cutaneous branches of the dorsal rami of L1-3 are blocked with an injection of
      local anesthetic between the internal oblique abdominal muscle (IOAM) and the transverse
      abdominal muscle(TAM)This technique allows sensory blockade of the anterolateral abdominal
      wall via local anesthetic deposition superficial to the transversus abdominis muscle. It was
      first described by McDonnell et al. as a landmark technique to provide analgesia for lower
      abdominal surgery.

      Hebbart et al. subsequently described an ultrasound guided technique for the TAP block which
      they named posterior TAP block. The ultrasound allows identification of the external oblique
      abdominal muscles (EOAM),IOAM and TAM. Previous studies about ultrasound -guided regional
      anesthetic techniques suggest improved block quality and safety, which is primarily due to
      direct visualization of the relevant anatomy, the tip of the needle, and the spread of the
      local anesthetics.

      Clinical trials of the single shot posterior TAP block have shown a significant reduction in
      morphine consumption during the first 24-36 hours after surgery. More recently, El-dawlatly
      et al. demonstrated that ultrasound guided TAP block in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy reduced perioperative opioid consumption by more than 50%.

      This is the first study to evaluate the effect of TAP block in the quality of recovery in

      The use of iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) remains the gold-standard in spinal reconstructive
      surgery for achieving fusion. Major complications from the harvesting of ICBG are rare, but
      chronic pain has been reported in 10-39%. Catheters implanted at the time of surgery have
      been used to provide local anesthetic at the harvest site for 24-48 hours after surgery. This
      has been shown to decrease chronic pain at 4 years post-operatively. A single application of
      local anesthetic at surgery has been shown to decrease pain at the harvest site for up to 5
      days. No study has demonstrated a benefit to using a single application of local anesthetic
      at the ICBG site beyond 5 days. In current clinical practice, the use of a local anesthetic
      at the ICBG site is determined according to surgeon preference. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if a single application of bupivacaine at the ICBG site, as currently done in
      some cases, provides any pain relief beyond 5 days such as that demonstrated with longer
      infusions of local anesthetics.

      Post-stroke shoulder pain is defined as pain in the shoulder area that starts after a person
      has had a stroke. The SPR System is an investigational device that is being studied for the
      relief of post-stroke shoulder pain. The SPR System uses electrical stimulation and includes
      a Trial Stage (where a temporary system is used to see if the subject may benefit from this
      type of therapy) and may include an Implant Stage (where a small device is implanted under
      the skin in the chest). The SPR System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the shoulder
      where the subject feels pain. This research study will evaluate the effect of electrical
      stimulation on shoulder pain.

      Individuals who are over the age of 21, who had a stroke at least six months ago, who
      experience shoulder pain, and have tried other therapies for their shoulder pain, may be
      eligible to participate in the first stage of the SPR System. Subjects meeting the specified
      success criteria at the conclusion of the SPR Trial Stage who experience a return of pain
      within 6 months of completion of the Trial Stage may be eligible for the second stage (SPR
      Implant Stage). This research study lasts a little over 3 years and may include 17 visits to
      the study doctor and at least 8 telephone calls from study staff.

      The use of methadone to provide analgesia may be increasing due to advantages compared to
      other commonly used opioid analgesic drugs. While efficacy of methadone has been reported in
      adults, there is a paucity of information in neonates and infants. In the latter population,
      fentanyl and morphine are most commonly used for opioid analgesia following major surgery,
      while methadone is frequently used for weaning of opioid dependent and tolerant patients, in
      spite of the paucity of knowledge of methadone pharmacology in this population. There are
      several clinical problems associated with fentanyl and morphine, and methadone may offer
      superior efficacy with fewer side effects than these agents. We propose to study the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of methadone in neonates and infants in the
      intensive care unit following cardiac surgery.

      Post-stroke shoulder pain is a major rehabilitation problem affecting moderate to severely
      impaired stroke survivors. Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of muscles surrounding the
      hemiparetic shoulder has been demonstrated to be beneficial, but despite the evidence for
      therapeutic benefit, the clinical implementation of surface ES for poststroke shoulder pain
      has been difficult. In order to address the limitations of surface ES, the investigative team
      pioneered the development of percutaneous intramuscular (IM) ES for the treatment of
      post-stroke shoulder pain. However, prior to acceptance by the clinical community, additional
      gaps in the scientific and clinical knowledge need to be addressed. This study begins to do
      so. The primary objective is to estimate the relative pain reduction associated with IM ES
      vs. ""usual care."" We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit a larger effect size with
      respect to pain reduction compared to ""usual care"". A secondary objective is to estimate the
      effect on health related QOL of IM ES vs. ""usual care."" Demonstration of improvement in QOL
      will validate the clinical relevance of the intervention. We hypothesize that the IM ES group
      will exhibit greater improvement in health related QOL compared to ""usual care"".

      The purpose of the study is to determine the opiate sparing effects of intravenously
      administered dexamethasone in outpatient knee surgery. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid with
      well known antiemetic effects. However, the analgesic effects of dexamethasone have not been
      adequately researched. Following surgery, patients are typically discharged home with PO
      opiates to manage post-operative pain. The investigators believe that by using VAS (Visual
      Analog Scale) for Pain the investigators can show that a single dose of dexamethasone can
      reduce pain scales and opiate consumption post-operatively, on Post Operative Day (POD 1)

      The investigators hypothesize that subjects will have greater pain relief when taking
      IR-oxycodone compared with ER-oxycodone for several reasons. The ability to take a varying
      amount of medication at six different points over the course of a day will allow patients to
      take as much (or as little) medication as they need to control their pain. In addition, the
      ability to vary the medication doses in this way will give them a greater sense of control,
      which will also contribute to greater pain relief. Similarly, the investigators predict that
      patients will show greater benefits with IR-oxycodone on the measures of physical and
      emotional functioning. Because there is relatively little data on sleep apnea in chronic pain
      patients (Webster et al., 2008), these assessments are exploratory and not hypothesis-based.
      Finally, although it is typically thought that the abuse liability of IR-opioid medications
      is greater than for ER-medications, the data on which this belief are based have not involved
      systematic studies of patients with chronic pain; the assessments of abuse liability will
      therefore also be exploratory.

      pain. One arm will be given 3 days of preoperative darifenacin and the control group will
      have the standard of care which is no preoperative anticholinergic medication. The primary
      endpoints will be decreased pain scores and less ER visits and hospital admissions for stent
      difficulty. These will be assessed by a pain diary completed by the participant as well as a
      questionnaire when the participant returns to clinic for stent removal. Also included in
      evaluation of the primary end point will be patient phone calls, ER visits and admissions for
      stent difficulty. Secondary endpoints will be narcotic and postoperative anticholinergic use.
      This will also be assessed with the pain diary completed by the participant. Participants
      will be included in the study if they are undergoing a procedure that a stent will likely be
      required. This will include participants who will have ureteroscopy or extracorporeal shock
      wave lithotripsy and a stone 1 cm or larger. Also participants with stones smaller than 1 cm
      who due to anatomy of the ureter or kidney will likely need a stent on preoperative
      evaluation will also be included in the study. Included as well in the study are participants
      who will undergo renal or ureteral surgery that a ureteral stent will be utilized.
      Participants will be randomized after consent is obtained into two groups. One group will
      receive standard of care which is no preoperative anticholinergic medications. The second
      group will receive the three day treatment with darifenacin pre procedure. Participants in
      the second group will be instructed on side effects of darifenacin and given appropriate
      contact information prior to initiation of the medication. Both groups will be followed
      postoperatively with a pain diary. Postoperative follow up will continue until the stent is
      removed 1-2 weeks after the procedure. The exact time of stent removal will depend on the
      success and nature of the surgery and will be at the discretion of the surgeon. Participants
      will be able to voluntarily stop the medication for any reason as well as if they have
      serious side effects from the medication. Data to be collected from each group includes age,

      The overall goal of this study is to examine the effect of a single dose of TENS on mucositis
      pain and function secondary to head and neck radiation therapies. Oral mucositis is an
      extremely debilitating, unpreventable condition (inflammation, ulcers, bleeding in the mouth,
      nose, and throat) that causes significant pain, functional impairment, and diminished quality
      of life. Head and neck cancers pose specific challenges to effective pain management and past
      studies suggest the use of effective non-pharmacologic strategies such as TENS may be
      particularly beneficial for avoiding sources of acute and chronic pain, thereby improving
      quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of TENS will decrease pain
      and improve function and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients. This project is
      particularly innovative because it is the first known study to examine the efficacy of TENS,
      an established safe, inexpensive and easy-to-use non-pharmacologic pain management
      intervention, for treating acute oral mucositis pain. The investigators research translates
      bench (animal model) science to human subjects using an interdisciplinary approach to pain
      management. Establishing whether TENS is effective for reducing mucositis pain is a critical
      first step toward establishing an effective, non-pharmacologic pain relief intervention for
      mucositis.

      Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging (US) is a procedure used to evaluate skeletal muscle size
      and function to inform clinical practice. US has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool
      for measuring changes in trunk muscle (i.e. abdominal and back muscle) size and activity
      during sub-maximal contractions in younger populations. Younger adults with low back pain as
      compared with healthy adults without pain demonstrate smaller back muscle size, lower back
      muscle activity, and greater back muscle asymmetry (differences in right side compared with
      left side).

      No trials are published evaluating muscle adaptations using US in response to clinical
      treatments for low back pain in the older adult population. Increased muscle size and
      improved muscle symmetry have been reported in younger adults with low back pain who
      participate in low back stabilization exercises. These exercises use voluntary contractions
      of the back muscles with prolonged hold times and low loads. Neuromuscular Electrical
      Stimulation (NMES) is a treatment modality that increases muscle activity when voluntary
      activity is impaired and increases muscle size. Most studies assessing muscle size and
      activity in response to NMES have been conducted in the knee muscles (i.e. the quadriceps),
      while the impact of NMES on the back muscles remains relatively unexplored. Given the
      potential to evaluate back muscle size and activity with US, this assessment tool may be used
      to document muscle adaptations to a clinical intervention in older adults with low back pain.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a 6-week clinical trial to determine if NMES plus
      lumbar stabilization exercises (i.e. NMES AND Stabilization Exercises) is superior to lumbar
      stabilization exercises (i.e. Moist Heat AND Stabilization Exercises) for improving back
      muscle size, activity, and side-to-side (i.e. right side versus left side) symmetry in older
      adults with chronic low back pain (i.e. low back pain of greater than 3 months). Muscle size,
      activity, and symmetry will be assessed using US before and after the treatments to determine
      if the treatments positively impact muscle. Secondary clinical measures of success will
      include improvements in physical, psychological, and social function pre- to post-treatment.

      Purpose and Background The purpose of this research study is to investigate the benefits of
      mixing lidocaine and bupivacaine for numbing the skin. Lidocaine and bupivacaine are two
      commonly used medications to numb the skin for minor procedures. Lidocaine has a faster
      onset. Bupivacaine has a longer duration. They are often combined with epinephrine to
      increase the length of action. These medications are used to control pain at the time of the
      operation and to decrease discomfort immediately afterward. Participating in the study
      involves injection of local anesthetic containing lidocaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine and
      bupivacain with epinephrine at 4 sites on the forearm. Your participation will potentially
      improve the administration of these medications in persons undergoing a variety of
      procedures. You will be one of approximately 25 healthy volunteer subjects in this research
      study.

      Increasing accessibility of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, like intrauterine
      devices (IUDs), is an important strategy to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy.
      Unfortunately, fear of IUD insertion in women who have not had children is common among
      health care providers and women alike, and this limits IUD use. To increase acceptance of
      this highly effective contraceptive, there is need to investigate novel, low cost, easily
      applied and accessible techniques to improve the insertion experience. This is a pilot study
      to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nitroprusside gel applied intracervically as an

      Although ambulatory gynecological laparoscopy is considered to be a minimally invasive
      surgical procedure, only 60% of patients undergoing this procedure are satisfied with
      postoperative pain control. Postoperative pain can lead to physiological, immunological and
      psychological derangements in patients.It also has been shown to be the most common cause of
      hospital admission after outpatient surgery.

      Opioids constitute the most commonly used pain management strategy after surgery, however
      they have many undesirable side effects including nausea, vomiting and respiratory
      depression. Different strategies have been developed to decrease the amount of opioid
      required after surgery. Opioid sparing drugs as well as regional anesthesia have been shown
      to be effective. Systemic administration of lidocaine has been shown to decrease opioid
      consumption, improve recovery of bowel function and promote a better recovery after inpatient
      procedures. Lidocaine has been shown to have analgesic, antihyperalgesic and
      anti-inflammatory properties. It also has an excellent safety profile when give by a low-dose
      infusion.

      The improvement of surgical technique and anesthesia care has made major adverse outcomes
      infrequent, especially in the ambulatory setting. Assessing patient's quality of recovery has
      become an important outcome in several studies. The patient's capacity to return to his
      normal activities is one of the most important sign of a successful outpatient procedure and
      it has significant economic implications.

      Quality of recovery -40(QoR-40) is a validated 40 item instrument to assess the quality of
      post-operative recovery. Myels et al. have concluded that the QoR-40 would be a useful
      outcome measure to assess the impact on changes in health care delivery, but anesthesia
      studies underutilize this instrument.

      The research question for the study is; does the use of systemic perioperative lidocaine
      improve quality of recovery after outpatient laparoscopy?

      Tonsillectomy is the most common pediatric surgical procedure performed in the US. The
      postoperative period can be particularly painful. Codeine (usually in mixed formulation with
      acetaminophen) is the most commonly prescribed opioid in the US. However, evolving data
      questions its ability to provide optimal pain relief, while avoiding side effects, especially
      in the postoperative setting. Tramadol may be a better option for children in the
      postoperative setting due to its well-documented analgesic properties, low potential for side
      effects, and excellent safety profile. Seventy-two children scheduled to undergo
      tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) at Children's will be invited to participate in
      a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of
      codeine with acetaminophen versus tramadol. Using a 10-day take-home diary, caregivers will
      be asked to record daily information about their child's postoperative pain and other core
      outcomes and domains as recommended in the recent consensus statement put forth by the
      Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials
      (IMMPACT) (McGrath et al., 2008). This study will offer new information regarding the
      efficacy and side effects associated with tramadol as compared with codeine/acetaminophen
      (the current practice standard) in a pediatric population.

      Hypotheses

      H1: Children who receive scheduled tramadol following tonsillectomy will report better pain
      control than children who receive scheduled codeine/acetaminophen.

      H2: Children who receive scheduled tramadol following tonsillectomy will report fewer side
      effects than children who receive scheduled codeine/acetaminophen.

      The intrauterine device (IUD) is a long-acting, highly effective, reversible contraceptive
      that may be underutilized due to fear of pain during insertion. Although providers frequently
      prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for IUD insertion, there is no
      evidence for any pain reduction. In fact, no interventions evaluated in randomized controlled
      trials have been shown to be effective in reducing pain during IUD insertion. While many
      women tolerate IUD insertion well, others have moderate to severe pain. This double-blind
      randomized controlled trial of 150 women aims to estimate the efficacy of intracervical 2%
      lidocaine gel compared to placebo (KY jelly) to reduce IUD insertion pain. Our hypothesis is
      that women who are treated with 2% lidocaine gel prior to IUD insertion will have reduced
      pain as measured on a 0 mm to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). We will be able to detect a
      15 mm difference on the VAS with our sample size. Other data to be collected include
      information regarding age, BMI, obstetric history, lactation status, time since pregnancy or
      delivery, last menstrual period, history of cervical conization, anxiety levels, anticipated
      pain levels, insertion characteristics (time, difficulty, complications), side effects, and

      The project's objective is to explore the impact of Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR)
      on pain regulation, social stress, basic affective and attention functions, and on the brain,
      immune, and endocrine mechanisms that subserve these processes. Specifically, the
      investigators hypothesize that participants undergoing MBSR training will show decreased
      emotional distress on self-report measures, increased sustained attention on a behavioral
      task, decreased stress levels on a social stress test, decreased general psychosocial stress
      as indexed by diurnal salivary cortisol profile, changes in inflammatory response, modulation
      of cellular aging, and different neural patterns in response to thermal pain and aversive
      visual stimuli as indexed by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

      To test these hypotheses, the study will recruit 50 participants through the UW-Madison
      Integrative Medicine Program. All participants will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week
      MBSR program or to an 8-week training program in health-enhancement. At the conclusion of the
      study, participants will be invited to participate to the second class should they be
      interested. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, fMRI
      scanning, cortisol sampling, and blood sampling before training begins, after the first
      program ends, and again four months after the first program ends and prior to the second
      program.

      If hypotheses are supported, the study may benefit participants by reducing their
      psychological distress, increasing their well-being, and helping them better manage pain and
      aversive stimuli. There are no other direct benefits to participants. Potential risks
      associated with fMRI include ferromagnetic collision, neurostimulation effects, and
      psychological discomfort. Potential risks to subjects include slight potential discomfort in
      providing saliva samples, discomfort of painful thermal stimulation, stress associated with
      the Trier Social Stress Test, some psychological discomfort from viewing disturbing
      photographs as part of the compassion fMRI study, and breach of confidentiality.

      Consent for the present study will entail both written and verbal descriptions of the
      protocol. Subjects will be informed that their participation is completely voluntary, and
      that they can withdraw at any time.

      While narcotic medication are commonly used for pain control near the time of surgery, there
      are significant side effects including constipation, nausea, risk of overdose leading to
      decreased breathing, and risk of addiction to narcotics. Our goal is to explore alternatives
      to narcotics for perioperative pain for patients undergoing sperm retrieval surgery. We have
      designed a prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate how effective the
      anti-inflammatory medicine celecoxib(Celebrex) is for pain control near the time of surgery.
      Celecoxib is known as a COX-2 inhibitor, a drug that belongs to the non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class. It is used to reduce swelling and to treat pain.

      Patients will be divided into two groups: the first group receives a celecoxib pill and the
      second group receives a sugar pill(placebo). Patients and doctors will be unaware of exactly
      which pills are given. The patient will complete questionnaires for pain level. By comparing
      the pain levels we can better understand whether celecoxib (Celebrex) significantly
      decreases perioperative pain.

      This research is being done to compare two methods of giving fentanyl, a narcotic often given
      to patients following brain surgery and determine if one method has more side effects than
      the other. Both of these methods are available in the postoperative treatment of pain. This
      research also is being done to determine if patients receiving narcotic pain medicine will
      benefit from additional monitoring of carbon dioxide levels. Since narcotic pain medicines
      can slow down breathing, The investigators want to see if measuring exhaled carbon dioxide
      levels will help identify a slower breathing rate and improve safety.

      Patients undergoing deep sedation for outpatient procedures typically receive a combination
      of benzodiazepines, propofol, and opioids. Side effects of such anesthetics include
      respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and urinary retention, with resultant extended
      hospital stays and unanticipated admission. The use of dexmedetomidine for deep sedation may
      increase patient safety by maintaining respiratory drive, while providing sedation, hypnosis,
      and analgesia. Furthermore, patients may experience decreased pain, nausea, and time to
      discharge in the PACU, especially if dexmedetomidine decreases the requirement of other drugs
      such as opioids.

      The hypothesis of this study is administration of dexmedetomidine during deep sedation for
      ambulatory hysteroscopic surgery will result in a 50% reduction of intraoperative opioid
      compared to sedation with propofol.

      The research objective is to determine which physical therapy (PT) treatment is the most
      efficacious for patients with lower back pain (LBP), who have been subgrouped based on
      certain clinical features. There is only limited evidence that supports any one PT treatment
      for patients with LBP since PT treatment outcomes for exercise protocols are equivocal, given
      the heterogeneous clinical features of patients with LBP. Thus, classification of patients
      with LBP into subgroups with shared clinical features has been identified as a research
      priority by several groups in order to prescribe the most efficacious PT treatment for each
      homogeneous subgroup. The investigators hypothesize that particular PT treatments are most
      efficacious when applied to patients with LBP, who present with particular clinical and

      The pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) manifestations, are complex with
      interactions of intracellular hemoglobin, membrane and endothelial activation but the
      hallmark remains recurrent and painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC). These painful episodes
      are thought to result from ischemia caused when small blood vessels are occluded by
      misshapen, inflexible erythrocytes. Painful episodes are the most common cause of
      hospitalization, morbidity, and impairment for SCD patients. There is no therapy that
      completely prevents or directly aborts painful events for all patients. Consequently,
      treatment for acute VOC is primarily supportive using hydration and medicinal pain control.
      Every pain medication has the potential to relieve pain but is associated with significant
      limitations and side effects.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested in this double blind, randomized controlled trial is that
      Nalbuphine is equivalent to morphine for pain control and patients will suffer fewer episodes
      of acute chest syndrome. The investigators also expect subjects will report fewer side
      effects from respiratory depression, abdominal distention from reduced peristalsis, reduced
      histamine release causing pruritis and still be provided adequate pain control. Further
      hypotheses to be tested is ability to recruit patient participants while being treated in the
      Emergency Department and that continuous infusion of Nalbuphine with accompanying patient
      controlled analgesia (PCA) is safe and effective in controlling pain, requiring less total

      In this study the investigators will be comparing two different types of anesthetic, a
      numbing eye drop and a numbing gel, to test if they are equally effective or if one has a
      better outcome in terms of the level of comfort you experience one hour and one day after
      your surgery. The two medications are commonly used and appear to be equally effective for
      other types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery. This study will show if one type of
      anesthesia is preferred over another by patients getting LASIK. Before your LASIK procedure,
      you will be given a short questionnaire to determine the baseline comfort of your eyes. In
      the operating room, one type of anesthetic will be put in one eye, and the other medication
      will be put in the other eye. Which anesthetic you get in each eye will be chosen in a random
      way (similar to flipping a coin). After your LASIK surgery, the investigators will ask you if
      you felt more comfort in your right eye, your left eye, or if they were equal, and the
      investigators will ask you the same survey questions that were asked prior to your LASIK to
      get more details about your experience.

      *Of note- the randomization being done is for which eye will be receiving the lidocaine and
      which eye will be receiving the tetracaine. Each patient will receive lidocaine in 1 eye and
      tetracaine in the other eye, the randomization is for each individual eye. This means, of 11
      patients in our study, 22 eyes received treatment. 11 eyes received lidocaine and 11 eyes
      received tetracaine.

      when we did our comparison, 11 values were used for lidocaine and 11 eyes were used for
      tetracaine, giving a total of 22 eyes. This is important to note since the randomization
      refers to EYE for each individual patient, and not for the patient (ie: participant means 1
      eye, not 1 person in the descriptions below).

      Remote Ischemic PreConditioning (RIPC) will improve the postoperative pain experience in
      patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Although abdominal surgery can be a lifesaving
      procedure many people have a significant amount of postsurgical pain. Severe postsurgical
      pain may lead to chronic pain in some people. ""Remote Ischemic Preconditioning"" may reduce
      the amount of postsurgical pain. Remote ischemic preconditioning is done by inflating a
      balloon (very similar to a blood pressure cuff) on the leg until it blocks blood flow for a
      few minutes. The cuff is then deflated and blood flow resumes. The process is repeated up to
      three times. This procedure causes the body to increase its natural pain relief system that
      may help to decrease the amount of postsurgical pain.

      This study will compare the effects of oral pregabalin with placebo on postoperative pain and
      morphine usage after mastectomy.

      Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant agent approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic
      neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy.

      Women 18-70 years of age, undergoing unilateral modified mastectomy or lumpectomy with
      axillary node dissection will be recruited to participate in the study. Patients unable to
      cooperative, those that have known allergy to pregabalin or morphine and a history of drug or
      alcohol abuse, chronic pain, history of daily intake of analgesics or steroids, or impaired
      kidney function will all be excluded from the study. A pregnancy test will also be performed
      to exclude pregnant women from the study.

      Oral pregabalin 300 mg (or placebo) will be administered to patients 1-2 hours before surgery
      followed by 150 mg 12 hours later. Thereafter, 150 mg of oral pregabalin (or placebo) will be
      administered twice daily until day 14. Whether a patient receives pregabalin or placebo will
      be decided based on a process similar to tossing a coin.

      Patients will receive a standard general anesthetic for their operation and will receive
      intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine for pain in the immediate
      postoperative period. Oral opioids will be administered after discontinuation of the PCA.

      Subjects will be visited after the operation while in the hospital and intermittently for
      three months at the outpatient clinic after discharge from the hospital. Subjects will be
      asked to return remaining study drug/empty container when they are at the hospital for their
      2 week follow up visit.

      Potential adverse effects of pregabalin include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema,
      weight gain, headache, dry mouth, blurry vision, and ataxia. The incidence of these side
      effects occurring ranges variously between 1 and 25%. Investigators will closely monitor all
      patients for the occurrence of these side effects.

      Pain assessment and management deficiencies in nursing homes (NHs) are well documented.
      Unrelieved pain in this setting results in poorer resident outcomes, including depression,
      decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical and social functioning. This
      randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a pain management algorithm coupled
      with intense diffusion strategies in improving pain, physical function and depression among
      NH residents. Specific aims of the study are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a pain
      management algorithm (ALG) coupled with intense diffusion strategies, as compared with pain
      education (EDU) and weak diffusion strategies, in improving pain, mobility, and depression
      among NH residents; 2) Determine the extent to which adherence to the ALG and organizational
      factors are associated with changes in resident outcomes and the extent to which changes in
      these variables are associated with changes in outcomes; 3) Evaluate the persistence of
      changes in process and outcome variables at long-term follow-up and 4) Evaluate the
      relationships among behavioral problems and pain in severely cognitively impaired residents

      your discomfort at the legs. The researcher will be there to help, but the investigators want
      you to answer the questions on your own if you can. You will be asked to reach forwards
      standing next to a wall and to walk for 6 minutes after that. The tests will de done in

      should finish all of the testing and questionnaires in an hour or less, for a total of three
      hours over six weeks in the investigators clinic.

      home. You will be asked to wear them at night only for the next 6 weeks. Finally, the
      principal investigator will contact you weekly by phone, to discuss issues of comfort and

      tenaculum application to the cervix during office gynecologic procedures. This study will
      also evaluate how satisfied women are with the method of pain control used.

      The researchers hypothesize that:

        1. There is less pain perceived by patients undergoing placement of a tenaculum on the
           cervix when a lidocaine injection is used compared to a topical lidocaine gel.

        2. Patients are more satisfied with pain control during the overall experience of

      A national survey has revealed that 80% of patients experienced pain after surgery and 86% of
      these patients had moderate, severe or extreme pain (1).Postoperative pain can extend
      recovery room stay after surgery and it is also a common cause of unanticipated admissions
      which have important economic implications(2).More importantly, postoperative pain can lead
      to a poor quality of recovery in ambulatory patients. The Intraoperative use of medications
      that might decrease postoperative pain is therefore highly desirable.

      Some medications such as lidocaine and ketamine have been proved to decrease postoperative
      pain when given during the Intraoperative period in ambulatory patients(3,4) but it is still
      unknown if those medications can in fact lead to a better quality of recovery .

      Magnesium sulfate is a non-competitive calcium antagonist at the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor(5). NMDA receptors have an important role on pain modulation (6). The use of
      Intraoperative magnesium in order to decrease postoperative pain had contradictory results in
      different studies. Some studies have shown a potential benefit of magnesium in decreasing
      postoperative pain (7,8) while others have not demonstrated any benefit (9,10).

      In the ambulatory setting, specifically, Tramer et al. did not find any improvement on
      postoperative pain after an Intraoperative dose of magnesium for patients undergoing
      ilioinguinal hernia repair(11). Koinig et al., however, demonstrated a significant reduction
      in the postoperative analgesic requirements in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery
      (12).

      Even though, the reduction of postoperative opioid requirement has been used in many studies
      in the ambulatory literature, it has been recently questioned by some investigators
      (13).Patients might take more opioid medications but they may not necessarily develop opioid
      related side effects such as nausea and vomiting. A more global evaluation of the patient
      involving several aspects of recovery would be more significant.

      The modified quality of recovery 40(MQOR40) is a validated 40 item instrument to assess the
      quality of postoperative recovery (14). Myles et al. concluded that the MQOR40 would be a
      useful outcome measure to assess the impact on changes in health care delivery (15), but
      anesthesia studies underutilize this instrument.

      As more complex and painful procedures are being done in the ambulatory setting , the use of
      non-opioid strategies to control postoperative pain and to enhance quality of recovery will
      have even a greater role in the anesthetic management of patients. Magnesium has not been

      Pain after ambulatory surgery remains an unsolved problem in The United States and Europe. It
      is associated with delayed hospital discharge and it can result to an increased opioid
      consumption with adverse side effects. The concept of multimodal analgesic technique was
      introduced more than 15 years ago and several techniques have been studied over the years
      including non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, gabapentoids,
      ketamine, local and regional anesthetic techniques. Histamine can have effects on polymodal
      nociceptors and C-fibers, producing pain which is further increased by neurogenically
      mediated release of substance P from afferent pain fibers. Several non-selective or H1
      -selective histamine receptors antagonists have been demonstrated in animal models and
      clinical pain. Chia et al demonstrated that preoperative promethazine had opioid sparing
      properties without adverse sedative effects in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.

      Diphenhydramine is an anti-histamine drug who has been found to be effective in reducing
      postoperative nausea and vomiting after ambulatory surgery but its effects on postoperative
      pain and other important outcomes after ambulatory surgery such as time to meet discharge
      criteria have not being studied.

      The MQOR 40 is a validated instrument that was specifically design to evaluate patient
      recovery after anesthesia and surgery. This instrument can be particularly valid to examine
      interventions which affect different spheres of patient recovery as is the case of
      diphenhydramine. The objective of this study is to determine a dose response effect of
      preoperative diphenhydramine on postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery.
      The use of preoperative diphenhydramine can improve patient's quality of recovery, decrease
      postoperative pain, opioid consumption and opioid related side effects after ambulatory
      surgery.

      The research question: Does a preoperative dose of diphenhydramine improve postoperative
      quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery? The hypothesis of this study is that

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, the safety, and the tolerability
      of intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) in relieving acute pain in adults ages 18-65 who come to the
      ED seeking care. Considering all ED visits, pain is the most common chief complaint. Giving
      intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) after stomach and dental surgeries has been shown to be safe and
      effective, but no studies have investigated the use of intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) for the
      treatment of acute pain in the ED.

      Ketorolac (Sprix) has several advantages over other drugs commonly given for pain, including
      opioids. Ketorolac (Sprix) is non-addicting and has fewer side effects than opioids. The
      administration of ketorolac (Sprix) by other methods, such as IV, intramuscular shot, and
      oral pill form, has been shown to be safe and effective in treating acute pain.

      This study is being done to find out if giving ketorolac (Sprix) as a single dose nasal spray
      will have the same benefit in decreasing patient's pain.

      The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of Mindfulness Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) training for the treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with
      chronic pain. The study also aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying MBCT on a
      psychological and neurobiological level. For this purpose the study subjects will fill out
      several psychological questionnaires related to mindfulness, depression and chronic pain.
      Moreover this study involves optional fMRI scans of the brain and blood measures before and
      after the intervention.

      Main hypotheses:

        1. The MBCT training will be a feasible intervention in patients with chronic pain and
           co-morbid depression as defined by no occurrence of serious adverse events related to
           the intervention and a retention rate of more than 70% in the subjects assigned to the
           MBCT arm.

        2. Patients who have completed the MBCT training will demonstrate a significant decrease in
           depressive symptoms as measured on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -
           Clinician rated (QIDS-C16), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17)
           (QIDS-C/HRDS) severity scale for depressive symptoms (the primary outcome measure),
           compared to the control group.

      Increasing ease of access of long-acting birth control methods, like intrauterine devices
      (IUDs), is an important way to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. Unfortunately, fear
      of IUD insertion in women who have not had children is common among health care providers and
      women alike, and this limits IUD use. To increase acceptance of this highly effective birth
      control method, there is a need to explore new, low cost, and easily applied methods to
      improve the insertion experience. This is a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness and
      acceptability of nitroglycerin ointment applied vaginally to improve the IUD insertion
      experience for both patient and provider. The investigators hypothesis is that nitroglycerin
      ointment will decrease the pain associated with IUD insertion.

      The surgical placement of dental implants is presently a common procedure performed by oral
      surgeons, periodontists, and general dentists. The surgery can be performed under local
      anesthesia and involves the incision of soft tissue to expose the underlying bone,
      preparation of the implant site using a specialized surgical drill, and.screwing the implant
      into bone using a specialized headpiece. Dental implant patients experience postoperative
      pain yet there are no studies in the literature which have evaluated the efficacy of
      analgesics in this patient population. The current pilot study will evaluate the analgesic
      effects and tolerability of a recently FDA-approved analgesic formulation of intranasal
      ketorolac (SPRIX) in 25 patients who have 1 - 3 dental implants surgically placed. Patients
      will self administer the ketorolac nasal spray (one spray in each nostril, 31.5 mg total
      dose) when their postoperative pain reaches at least a moderate severity. Pain intensity and
      pain relief scores will then be recorded every 20 minutes for the first hour, at 1.5 and 2
      hours and then hourly through 6 hours on a validated analgesic diary. Side effects will be
      recorded when and if they occur. Patients will then transition to a multi-dose phase where
      they will be allowed to dose with ketorolac as indicated in the package insert (up to 4 times
      per day for 5 days). Patients will record the time of each dose, a daily assessment of
      overall efficacy and side effects, and the use of any rescue medication (acetaminophen 650

      Neuropathic pain / peripheral neuropathy (NP/PN) is a known painful complication of
      vincristine (VCR) therapy; evidence supporting the best treatment plan for pediatric patients
      is limited. Gabapentin is frequently used for VCR-related NP/PN, with variable dosing and
      scheduling regimens, and with varying measures of success. The hypothesis of the study is
      that gabapentin will reduce the severity of NP/PN in patients receiving vincristine during
      treatment for ALL on the Total XVI protocol (or for those being treated ""as per TOTXVI
      protocol""), as measured by two outcome measures: the daily dose of morphine used as needed
      for pain in addition to either gabapentin or placebo, as randomized, and the pain scores

      For most women, the most significant pain they will experience is the pain associated with
      childbirth. Up to one-third of women experience ""back labor"", this typically occurs when the
      fetus assumes varying degrees of malposition, especially the occiput posterior position, and
      causes additional constant pressure against the maternal spine and pelvis. ""Back labor""
      presents as constant pain, that occurs even between contractions. It is often difficult to
      manage, by the patient, the obstetrician, and the anesthesiologist, and may increase the rate
      of instrumental and caesarian delivery.

      Epidural anesthesia/analgesia is the most common and effective intervention used to help
      women cope with labor pain. Dilute concentrations of local anesthetic and opioid provide
      complete analgesia for most women. Some women, however, have breakthrough pain, often due to
      ""back labor,"" and require more concentrated drug solutions. This increases the side effects
      associated with these drugs (e.g., hypotension, pruritus, motor block), thus treatment of
      this pain poses a challenge for the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician.

      Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple and well-established method of managing labor
      pain among midwives. This intervention was first used to alleviate pain associated with
      kidney stones, and was introduced to obstetrics in the 1970s. Using a syringe, small amounts
      of sterile water is deposited subcutaneously near the sacral area. The sterile water causes
      osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15-30 second) and significant
      stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up
      to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times.

      Sterile water for pain management is most often administered using four intracutaneous
      injections: two sites lateral to the lumbosacral spine and two sites 2-3 cm below and 1-2 cm
      medial to the original two injection sites. 0.1 mL of sterile water is injected between the
      dermal layers to raise a small bleb on the skin surface at each of the four sites. In labor,
      the injections are administered sequentially during a uterine contraction, with the series of
      four injections, performed two at a time, completed within 20-30 seconds.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with
      neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic
      requirements and increase patient satisfaction.

      Children can develop abscesses (a collection of pus under their skin) that require a
      physician to cut it open to let the pus drain out. This is a painful procedure. Most medical
      professionals will use numbing cream and inject numbing medicine into the skin, just like at
      the dentist, to help reduce the pain. While this helps minimize the pain of cutting the skin,
      it doesn't help the pain associated with draining out the pus.

      There are many strategies and medications available to physicians to help decrease the pain
      of this procedure. Most of the medications available to treat the pain require the placement
      of an intravenous (IV) catheter through the patient's skin, which itself is a painful
      procedure. In the investigators emergency department, many patients with abscesses that need
      a procedure to drain the pus receive a medicine called morphine through an IV.

      Some pain medicines, however, can be sprayed into a patient's nose, and have been shown to be
      helpful at reducing the pain of a broken bone or a burn. These medicines do not require the
      placement of an IV.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a medicine called fentanyl, when
      sprayed into the nose of patients aged 4 to 18 years undergoing abscess drainage, is not
      worse than IV morphine in decreasing the pain of the procedure.

      After the risks and benefits of the study are explained to patients and their parents,
      written informed consent will be obtained. Written informed assent will be obtained for
      patients older than 8 years of age. Like the flipping of a coin, a computer program will
      decide randomly which half of the patients will receive fentanyl nose spray and which half
      will receive morphine by IV.

      The patients assigned to receive fentanyl nose spray will not have an IV placed. The patients
      assigned to receive morphine will have an IV placed. Both groups of patients will have the
      abscess drainage procedure done the same way. All patients will be videotaped in order to
      score their pain by a trained observer. This score is the main outcome (measurement) in the
      study.

      Background:

      - Some women with endometriosis have chronic pelvic pain. This pain may be caused by spasms
      of the pelvic floor muscles. These spasms can be detected by an examination. Studies suggest
      that botulinum toxin can help treat problems caused by muscle spasms. Researchers want to see
      if botulinum toxin injections into the pelvic floor muscles can decrease pain and spasms in
      women with pelvic pain.

      Objectives:

      - To see if botulinum toxin can relieve pain from pelvic floor spasm in women with pelvic
      pain.

      Eligibility:

      - Women between 18 and 50 years of age with pain associated with pelvic muscle spasm and
      endometriosis. Pain must be persistent (lasting for at least 3 months).

      Design:

        -  Participants will keep a pain diary and record their pain medication use for a month
           before the first visit.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Participants will also answer questions about their pain
           levels and quality of life.

        -  Participants will receive either botulinum toxin or a placebo (salt water) injection.
           The injection will be given into the pelvic floor muscles through the vaginal wall.
           Participants will take a muscle relaxant like Valium and have anesthetic cream put on
           the vaginal wall before the injection.

        -  After the injection, participants will keep a pain diary for another month.

        -  At a 1-month followup visit, participants will answer questions about their pain. If the
           pain has not improved, all participants may have a botulinum toxin injection (no
           placebo) into the pelvic floor muscles as before.

        -  Participants will have followup visits for up to a year after the initial 1-month
           followup visit.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two management
      strategies for patients with a recent onset of low back pain (LBP). One is based on usual
      care and the other is based on early access to physical therapy following a pragmatic
      treatment-based classification approach. The secondary purposes are to compare the subsequent
      healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies as well as to evaluate the
      importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of treatment. The overall
      hypothesis guiding the study is that the additional initial treatment expense incurred by
      early implementation will result in superior short-term clinical effectiveness, and will be
      more cost-effective in the long-term due to reduced healthcare utilization. We will also
      explore the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both treatment groups,
      which may provide insights for further improving treatment strategies.

      Peripheral nerve blocks are the standard of care for pain management after hip replacement
      surgery at UPMC Shadyside. This prospective, randomized study is intended to assess the
      effect of 0.1 versus 0.2% ropivacaine in lumbar plexus nerve catheter infusions after total
      hip arthroplasty. Ropivacaine peripheral nerve block infusions have been utilized as the
      standard of care at UPMC Shadyside for many years. Ropivacaine, a less potent left-isomer of
      bupivacaine, is often used in place of bupivacaine due to less motor blockade and less severe
      cardiovascular and central nervous system potential toxicity.

      Rationale: For the past 3 years the investigators have routinely used an axial subpleural
      tunneling technique that del

      Study Design: All patients over the age of 18 having an isolated thoracoscopic procedure
      performed at Inova Fairfax Hospital for therapeutic or diagnostics purposes will be screened.
      Patients will be excluded if they have: previous ipsilateral thoracic surgery, need for
      operative pleurectomy or pleurodesis, chronic use of pain medication, sedatives or hypnotics,
      drug allergies, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, history of peptic ulcerative disease,
      sleep apnea in need of Bipap, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inability
      to consent, or are pregnant. All patients included will be screened, consented, and operated
      on by the one year anniversary of institutional review board (IRB) approval.

      Study Methodology: Eighty-six consented patients will be randomized into the study arm (use
      of a pain catheter with 0.125% bupivacaine) or the standard of care group (no pain catheter).
      The primary outcome is the use of narcotic pain medication post-operatively, compared between
      study groups. Secondary outcomes will include postoperative pain scores, hospital and length
      of stay.

      The On-Q pump delivers local anesthetic to the intercostal space, without leakage elsewhere,
      creating a functional multi level rib block. Despite positive subjective results, objective
      data is lacking. The investigators have also noted that some patients develop an annoying
      short term paresthesia that has been minimized by using lower anesthetic concentrations than
      described in other publications.

      Objectives: To evaluate visual analog pain scores post-operatively up to 30 days
      post-operative, and to determine any association between pain management and length of stay.

      Study Type: A prospective randomized 2-arm study will be performed. Statistical Methodology:
      Total amount of narcotic pain medication administered through postoperative day 7, will be
      compared between the study groups using student's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
      Secondary outcomes, overall sum of pain scores through postoperative day 7, then at day 30
      post-operatively, hospital length of stay, and overall hospital cost, will also be compared
      among study groups using student's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

      The current study is designed to have broad generalizability and inform a potential shift
      toward greater utilization of stress echocardiography with UCA. This will be accomplished by
      comparing UCA stress echocardiography with myocardial SPECT among hospitalized patients
      presenting with atraumatic chest pain. This study seeks to demonstrate: clinical
      comparability of the 2 modalities (based on non-diagnostic test rates), improved care
      efficiency (based on length of stay), lower costs, improved provider satisfaction, and a
      presumed improved safety profile through the elimination of radiation exposure.

      Primary Hypothesis: A strategy of routine UCA (Optison) enhanced stress echocardiography
      will result in a clinically non-diagnostic test rate comparable to myocardial SPECT among
      patients hospitalized (inpatient or hospital observation status) with atraumatic chest pain.

      Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions are among the most prevalent conditions in VA primary
      care. Over the past two decades, improved clinical attention to pain has been associated with
      exponentially greater use of long-term opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, both
      within and outside the VA system. Despite this change in practice, the proper place of
      opioids in chronic pain management continues to be controversial because research has not
      demonstrated the long-term safety and effectiveness of opioids for chronic musculoskeletal
      pain. The Strategies for Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness (SPACE) Trial will
      fill a critical gap in the evidence by comparing effectiveness and harms of two clinically
      relevant analgesic prescribing strategies-one that emphasizes early use of strong opioids and
      one that delays and minimizes opioid use-for Veterans with chronic back, hip, or knee pain.
      SPACE is designed to be highly relevant to clinical decision-making in VA primary care and to
      produce knowledge that will improve the lives of Veterans living with chronic pain.

      Low back pain causes 2.4% of visits to US emergency departments (ED) resulting in 2.7 million
      visits annually. In a general low back pain (LBP) population, prognosis is poor. About 50% of
      patients who visited general practitioners with new onset musculoskeletal LBP report
      persistent pain and functional disability three months after the index visit. Outcomes are
      similarly poor for the population of patients forced to use an ED for management of their
      LBP. In an observational study of patients with non-traumatic LBP recently completed at the
      PI's institution, patients were contacted one week after ED discharge: 70% reported
      persistent back-pain related functional impairment, 59% reported moderate or severe LBP, and
      69% reported analgesic use within the previous 24 hours. Three months after the ED visit, 48%
      reported functional impairment, 42% reported moderate or severe pain, and 46% reported
      analgesic use within the previous 24 hours.

      A variety of evidence-based medications are available to treat LBP. Non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are more efficacious than placebo with regard to pain relief,
      global improvement, and requirement of analgesic medication. Skeletal muscle-relaxants too
      are effective for short-term pain relief and global efficacy. Opioids are commonly used for
      moderate or severe acute LBP,(9) though high-quality evidence supporting this practice is
      lacking.

      Treatment of LBP with multiple concurrent medications is common in the ED setting. Emergency
      physicians often prescribe NSAIDs, skeletal muscle relaxants, and opioids in combination.
      Several clinical trials have compared combination therapy with NSAIDS+ skeletal muscle
      relaxants to monotherapy with just one of these agents. These trials have reported
      heterogeneous results. The combination of opioids + NSAIDS has not been evaluated
      experimentally in patients with acute LBP.

      Given the poor pain and functional outcomes that persist beyond an ED visit for
      musculoskeletal LBP, the investigators propose a clinical trial to evaluate whether combining
      muscle relaxants or opioids with NSAIDs is more effective than NSAID monotherapy for the
      treatment of non-traumatic, non-radicular low back pain. Specifically, the investigators will
      evaluate three distinct hypotheses:

        1. The combination of naproxen + cyclobenzaprine will provide greater relief of LBP than
           naproxen alone seven days after an ED visit, as measured by the Roland Morris low back
           pain functional disability scale

        2. The combination of naproxen + oxycodone/ acetaminophen will provide greater relief of
           LBP than naproxen alone seven days after an ED visit, as measured by the Roland Morris
           low back pain functional disability scale

        3. The combination of naproxen + oxycodone/ acetaminophen will provide greater relief of
           LBP than naproxen + cyclobenzaprine seven days after an ED visit, as measured by the
           Roland Morris low back pain functional disability scale

      Each year, the number of breast cancer survivors who choose post-mastectomy breast
      reconstruction keeps rising. Among women who elect to pursue breast reconstruction,
      approximately 75% will choose prosthetic breast reconstruction. Implant-based breast
      reconstruction is frequently achieved in two-stages. The first stage consists of the
      placement of a tissue expander after mastectomy. This is followed by a period of biweekly
      tissue expansions that can last several months. In the second stage, the tissue expander is
      removed in a surgical procedure and replaced with a permanent breast implant. Tissue
      expansion is a well-established breast reconstruction technique characterized by high success
      rates and high patient satisfaction. Despite the well-recognized advantages of this
      successful breast reconstruction technique, the subpectoral placement of a tissue expander is
      associated with significant pain and discomfort in the immediate post-operative period and
      during the phase of tissue expansion. Pectoralis major muscle spasm is a frequently reported
      problem during tissue expansion. Legeby et al. recently showed that women who underwent
      prosthetic breast reconstruction had higher pain scores and took more analgesics that those
      who did not choose post-mastectomy reconstruction.

      In the past 10 years, publications on the use of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) for pain relief in
      a wide array of clinical conditions have increased tremendously. BTX-A is one of the
      neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. By reversibly inhibiting
      neurotransmitter release, BTX-A has both analgesic and paralytic properties. The analgesic
      action of BTX-A was initially thought to be related to its effects on muscular contraction.
      However, a recent in vitro study of embryonic rat dorsal neurons did confirm that BTX-A
      inhibits release of substance P, a neurotransmitter associated with pain and inflammatory
      reactions. The presence of analgesic properties of BTX-A is increasingly supported by several
      clinical observations: pain relief with BTX-A injections has been reported for migraine
      headaches, chronic pelvic, chronic tennis elbow, and post-operative pain control for lower
      limb lengthening correction, among others.

      This aspect has never been studied in breast cancer survivors who elect to pursue breast
      reconstruction with tissue expanders. Furthermore, physical function outcomes are important
      to consider with BTX-A use because the link between temporary muscle paralysis and
      improvements in participation in daily activities is not a given.

      The investigators propose to complete a double-blinded prospective randomized controlled
      trial of women undergoing unilateral and bilateral mastectomies with immediate placement of

      The investigators hypothesize that many parturients can, in fact, spontaneously micturate
      with low dose combined spinal epidural analgesic doses given for labor and that Foley
      catheterization is unnecessary in the majority of these parturients. At Prentice Women's
      Hospital, almost 9000 women annually receive neuraxial labor analgesia and 98% of those
      receive Foley catheters. By potentially reducing the necessity for Foley catheters, the
      investigators should be able to ultimately reduce the rate of bacteriuria, urinary tract
      infections and urethritis leading to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, as well as
      reduce costs of placing unnecessary Foley catheter.The hypothesis is parturients receiving
      low dose combined spinal epidural analgesia for analgesia after induction of labor who are
      randomized to a spontaneous micturition protocol will require fewer Foley catheter placements
      and demonstrate a lower incidence of positive urine culture postpartum than those who undergo

      Background: Noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) affects 200,000 new cases annually in USA. It is
      associated with poor quality of life and high health care expenditure of 8 Billion Dollars a
      year.

      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD), esophageal motility disorders, and psychological
      issues may cause NCCP.

      The mechanism(s) for pain continue to be explored and include central and peripheral
      hypersensitivity, and mechanophysical abnormalities. Treatment of NCCP has focused on
      relieving visceral hypersensitivity through pain modulators, such as tricyclics, trazodone,
      or adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline. Typically, only 40-50 % respond and clearly
      there is a large unmet therapeutic need.

      Cannabis is felt to be beneficial for vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal pain. The main
      component of Cannabis acts through specific receptors, that are located primarily on central
      and peripheral neurons (including the enteric nervous system) and myenteric plexus where they
      modulate neurotransmitter release. Activation of these receptors reduces excitatory enteric
      transmission and may improve esophageal hyperreactivity and hypersensitivity, the hallmarks
      of NCCP.

      STUDY PROTOCOL: The investigators will randomize 40 subjects with non-cardiac, non-reflux
      chest pain to receive dronabinol (5 mg Bid), or placebo for 4 weeks. Chest pain symptoms and
      esophageal sensorimotor properties will be assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks using symptom
      diary and impedance planimetry. The primary outcome measure will be the frequency of chest
      pain episodes. Secondary outcome measures include improvement in esophageal sensory
      thresholds, reduced reactive contractions, frequency, amplitude, area under the curve, and
      global improvement of symptoms.

      HYPOTHESIS: Cannabinoids decrease esophageal hypersensitivity and ameliorate chest pain in
      NCCP patients, when compared to placebo.

      AIM: To perform a randomized double blind study to investigate the effects of Dronabinol, a
      CB1 and CB2 agonist, in the treatment of patients with NCCP and examine its mechanism of
      action.

      This study will investigate the dose of hydromorphone which will relieve the pain of women in
      labor when delivered directly in the area around the spinal cord (i.e., intrathecal
      injection). The primary objective is to determine the dose of intrathecal hydromorphone that
      results in a pain score of less than 4 out of 10 thirty minutes after intrathecal injection
      in 50% of women. Secondary objectives include determining this dose at five and ten minutes
      after injection. Thirty women admitted to labor and delivery for planned vaginal delivery
      desiring epidural placement will be consented for the study. The starting dose of intrathecal
      hydromorphone will be 6 mcg. The up-and-down sequential allocation method of statistical
      analysis will be used, meaning that each subsequent dose will be dependent upon the result
      obtained from the prior dose - ergo, if the initial subject has pain relief, the second
      subject will receive 4 mcg (2 mcg less), but if the initial subject does not have pain
      relief, the second subject will receive 8 mcg (2 mcg more) of hydromorphone.

      After the intrathecal injection is given and the epidural is placed, visual analogue pain
      scores will be assessed 60 minutes following injection. A pain score of less than three will
      be a positive result. A pain score of three or greater will be a negative result. Blood
      pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, fetal heart rate, and any side effects will

      Low back pain affects 80% of Americans at some time during their lives. Although recovery
      usually occurs within 6 months, there is a 50% recurrence within one year's time. It has long
      been thought that poor control of trunk muscle may lead to abnormal forces across the spine,
      which then damage local spinal structures, thus, leading to low back pain. However, the
      investigators know little about the function of specific trunk muscles in healthy subjects
      during various activities of daily life. Furthermore, the precise muscle dysfunction
      associated with low back pain has not been well characterized at all. In addition, the
      investigators know little about which exercise protocol is most beneficial for particular
      subgroups of people with low back pain. Thus, the purposes of this study are to learn more
      about: 1) how trunk muscles are affected by low back pain; 2) which exercises might be most
      beneficial for people with certain kinds of low back pain; and 3) how these exercises
      influence trunk muscle function. By having a better understanding of which trunk muscles are
      affected by low back pain, rehabilitation specialists can design exercise programs and
      therapeutic interventions that are more specific and more effective.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of buffered local anesthesia
      injections to numb the gums and teeth during dental treatment. Adjusting the pH of lidocaine
      with sodium bicarbonate may reduce the pain of injection for both adults and children. In
      this study, the investigators will compare two local anesthetic preparations, a buffered
      anesthetic and the conventionally available anesthetic, for pain upon injection.

      Hypothesis: Anesthetic buffered to physiologic pH will result in a less painful injection
      compared to the acidic alternative used in most dental offices. This can be demonstrated by
      comparing two local anesthetic preparations, a buffered anesthetic and the conventionally
      available anesthetic, for pain upon injection.

      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major dose-limiting side effect of
      many chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
      bortezomib and ixabepilone. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy commonly occurs in
      greater than 40% of patients. To improve the peripheral neuropathy, the chemotherapy dosing
      is often either decreased or discontinued potentially affecting tumor responsiveness,
      prognosis, and survival.

      There is an unmet medical need for treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy induced
      neuropathic pain (CINP) and the proposed study will investigate the efficacy and safety of
      multiple dose levels of tetrodotoxin (TTX) versus placebo in moderate to severe neuropathic
      pain caused by chemotherapy.

      Intrauterine device (IUD) placement can be painful for patients during and after the
      procedure. Fear of pain from IUD insertion can be a barrier to obtaining this highly
      effective long acting reversible contraception. Currently there are no proven effective
      methods for reduction of pain during and after placement of modern IUDs (Mirena IUD and
      Paragard IUD). Ketorolac has not been studied in regards to decreasing pain during and after
      IUD insertion although it is used by some providers for this purpose. It is a strong NSAID
      that is indicated for the treatment of moderate acute pain. In the intramuscular form it has
      an analgesia onset of action at 30min, thus may be a plausible option for pain management in
      the office setting compared to oral NSAIDs, which have a longer time to onset of analgesia
      and have not been proven to be effective in reducing pain associated with IUD placement. The
      primary aim of this study is to determine whether ketorolac (Toradol) decreases pain
      associated with intrauterine device placement compared to placebo. We hypothesize that
      administration of ketorolac 30mg intramuscularly at least 30 minutes prior to IUD insertion

      Our research will examine a chest pain care strategy, called the HEART pathway, which is
      designed to correctly identify Emergency Department patients at high-risk for cardiovascular
      events, likely to benefit from further testing, and patients at very-low-risk for
      cardiovascular events, who may be safely discharged home. By using an individual's risk

      delivered to Emergency Department patients with chest pain. Our study will determine if the
      HEART pathway, which combines a clinical decision rule, the HEART score, and two serial
      troponin measurements, will reduce stress testing and cardiovascular imaging, decrease
      hospital length of stay, and reduce cost compared to usual care, while maintaining safety.

      Current practice guidelines for patients with acute low back pain (LBP) recommend a stepped
      care approach with initial treatment of education and advice to remain active. Referral to
      physical therapy is considered only when patients fail to recover after a few weeks. Recent
      research has led to the identification a subgroup of patients likely to experience rapid,
      pronounced, and sustained decreases in disability and pain with a brief manipulation and

      early referral to physical therapy instead of the usual care approach. The integration of
      this evidence into routine practice has not been evaluated. We will assess the outcomes of
      integrating this evidence into the management of patients with low back pain. The study is a
      randomized trial, comparing management with early manipulation with the current care process
      model. Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two groups. One
      group will be managed with the current care process model. The other group will be managed
      consistent with the decision rule recommending early referral for a brief manipulation and
      exercise intervention during the first 4 weeks. Patients will be followed over 1 year.

      Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a poorly understood chronic
      disorder of unknown etiology consisting of irritative bladder symptoms and pelvic pain that
      dramatically affects quality of life.

      Preclinical study data (obtained by using an IC/PBS model in Sprague-Dawley female rats) have
      demonstrated normalization of urinary frequency indicating that LP may be a potent protectant
      of the bladder mucosa against inflammation and irritation. Intravesical LP has so far
      demonstrated an excellent safety profile and minimal toxicity at concentrations of 2 mg/ml.
      Thus, we hypothesize that intravesical instillation of LP may form a molecular film on

      Emergence agitation (EA) occurs in up to 67% of pediatric patients after anesthesia for
      bilateral myringotomy tubes (BMT, ""ear tubes""). The goal of this study is to find out whether
      acetaminophen given well before surgery can decrease pain and therefore, decrease emergence
      agitation better than acetaminophen given shortly before or during surgery. EA can be
      dangerous for the patient because it may be hard to monitor their vital signs during an
      important phase of recovery, they may injure themselves, may require the presence of extra
      staff, and it can be very distressing to the parents. Causes of EA are not well understood,
      but it can be worsened by pain. 70% of patients undergoing BMT experience pain that needs
      treatment. Intranasal fentanyl, a strong analgesic, has been shown to decrease EA, but often
      ends up in dose-dependent nausea and vomiting. In previous studies and in common practice,
      acetaminophen is given either 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia or immediately after
      induction. The peak analgesic effect of acetaminophen is 60-120 minutes. Since the procedure
      is generally completed in 5-10 minutes, the therapeutic effect of acetaminophen may not be
      present upon emergence from anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if acetaminophen given 60-120 minutes prior to
      emergence can decrease EA in patients undergoing BMT. Patients would be randomized to one of
      three groups: Control will receive acetaminophen rectally while under anesthesia (standard
      practice), Group 1 will receive acetaminophen 10 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery,
      Group 2 will receive acetaminophen 20 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery. All groups
      would also receive a dose of intranasal fentanyl during the surgery, which is standard
      practice. Patients would be observed in the recovery room at various time points for evidence
      of EA and pain.

      Pain is the most common presenting symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety
      are the two most common mental disorders. All three conditions are often inadequately treated
      and result in substantial disability, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased
      health care costs and utilization. Additionally, pain, anxiety, and depression (PAD) are
      frequently comorbid with one another and have reciprocal negative effects on treatment
      response and additive effects on adverse health outcomes. The PAD triad is especially
      burdensome in Veterans, with their high prevalence of chronic pain, depression, PTSD, and
      other anxiety disorders. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical

      Patients typically experience moderate-to-severe pain following knee arthroplasty that is
      usually treated with a combination of oral and intravenous analgesics and enhanced by
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks. There are currently two locations to place a perineural
      catheter to provide analgesia following knee arthroplasty: a femoral nerve catheter and an
      adductor canal catheter. Both have been demonstrated to be effective following knee
      arthroplasty. However, it remains unknown if one location is superior to the other; or, more
      accurately, what the relative benefits are to each technique.

      While femoral CPNB has many benefits, one of the challenges of using this technique is that
      there is a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength which can be a limiting factor for
      rehabilitation. In contrast, the adductor canal catheter affects only the vastus medialis.
      This block may lessen block-induced quadriceps weakness following knee arthroplasty compared
      with a femoral infusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared with femoral perineural local anesthetic
      infusion, an adductor canal infusion is associated with a shorter time until four discharge
      criteria are met: (1) adequate analgesia; (2) independence from intravenous analgesics; (3)
      ability to ambulate 30 m; and (4) ability to stand, walk 3 m, and return to a sitting
      position without another's assistance.

      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common, costly and disabling conditions. It
      is often refractory to treatment, with patients requiring long-term opioid therapy.
      Mindfulness meditation is a promising treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive
      disorders. When combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a standard of care for
      CLBP, it may produce additive benefits. The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is
      to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an innovative behavioral intervention to improve
      the health of adults with opioid-treated CLBP. This RCT will test the hypotheses that, at 26

      a wait-list control group (usual care alone), will improve health-related quality of life
      (primary outcomes: pain severity and physical function) and reduce opioid medication use
      (secondary outcome). In addition, they will also decrease alcohol and drug use/misuse, and

      The study aims to determine if treating pediatric patients (age 7-17) for four weeks with
      omeprazole prior to tonsillectomy will decrease post tonsillectomy pain. The hypothesis is
      that many patients have silent laryngopharyngeal reflux and by reducing the acid entrance
      into the oropharynx, patients will have less post tonsillectomy pain due to decreased acid
      irritation of the surgical wound (tonsil fossas).

      The study will be a prospective double blind randomized study. Participants will be invited
      to participate in the study by giving the study information at the preoperative assessment,
      when the decision is made to have a tonsillectomy performed. If the patient agrees to
      participate in the study, a written consent and child assent will be obtained and the patient
      will be randomly assigned to a treatment versus control group based on the randomly assigned
      participant number.

      The treatment group will then be given a four week course of omeprazole to be taken for the
      four weeks prior to tonsillectomy. The patient will be given a post tonsillectomy assessment
      form. The form looks at postoperative pain (using a visual analog scale 1-10) as well as oral
      intake at postoperative day 0,1,3,5,7,10, and 14. The form will be turned in at the
      postoperative visit or mailed in.

      The pain level and oral intake between the two groups to will be compared to determine if
      antireflux control helps decrease the postoperative pain after tonsillectomy.

      Seventy percent of surgeries performed in the United States are done in an outpatient
      setting.Pain Control after ambulatory surgery is very challenging because patients do not
      have access to fast and potent intravenous medications Pain after ambulatory surgery is
      poorly controlled in the United States with up to seventy five percent of patients having
      moderate to severe pain after ambulatory procedures. Postoperative pain have been associated
      with serious morbidity, including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.

      The use of intraoperative opioids can result in an exaggerated response to pain
      (hyperalgesia) and contribute to an exacerbation of pain after surgical procedures.Opioids
      are commonly given intraoperative, not in response to pain, but in response to hyperdynamic
      cardiovascular states. Esmolol is a short acting beta 1 antagonist that can be used to
      treat/prevent hyperdynamic states during surgery. More importantly, esmolol has been shown to
      have central antihyperalgesic effects that might contribute to a reduction in postoperative
      pain. It is therefore conceivable that the use of intraoperative esmolol instead of opioids
      to avoid hyperdynamic states during surgery can result in lower postoperative pain. Since
      postoperative pain can substantially affect postoperative quality of recovery, it is also
      conceivable that the use of intraoperative esmolol might result in an improved postoperative
      quality of recovery to surgical patients.

      The main objective of the current study is to examine the effect of intraoperative esmolol on
      postoperative quality of recovery. A secondary objective is to examine the effect of esmolol
      on postoperative pain.

      Significance: Postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery has been shown to be poorly managed
      in The United States. The goal of this study is to investigate if a change in the
      intraoperative pharmacologic management of patients undergoing ambulatory surgery can improve
      their postoperative quality of recovery and pain.

      The research question is; does the use of intraoperative esmolol improve postoperative
      quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery? Does the use of intraoperative esmolol improve
      postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery?

      The hypotheses of this study is; does the use of intraoperative esmolol improves
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery. The use of intraoperative esmolol
      reduces postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery.

      In light of the importance of pain and widespread interest in patient-centeredness, the
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been emphasizing and successfully making pain and its
      management a routine feature of the health record and a focus of care. Awareness of pain and
      efforts to improve pain management rest on the VA's '5th Vital Sign' - a policy and practice
      of nursing staff routinely screening for 'pain now' at every health encounter using a 0-10
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

      The team's previous research on VA's '5th Vital Sign' informs the specific design of this
      Effective Screening for Pain (ESP) study as well as the proposed research products.

      Alternatives to the current pain screening approach may improve the sensitivity and
      specificity of screening for chronic pain. These alternatives include the nurse administered
      NRS with a one week look back period and a three item scale (PEG) incorporating intensity and
      emotional and physical interference. The PEG is very similar to the gold standard Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) from which it is derived, in its sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity to
      change in detecting clinically important, functionally impairing pain.

      The investigators plan to evaluate alternatives to the VA's current '5th Vital Sign' for pain
      screening, focusing on simple, feasible measures that can be used cross-sectionally for pain
      screening. In the setting of a primary care clinic, the investigators plan to
      cross-sectionally evaluate three arms - a tablet based DVPRS, a tablet computer-based NRS one

      Biofreeze is a topical analgesic, frequently used in the office or given to a patient for
      home use as a way to mitigate pain during the course of treatment. Rehabilitative exercises
      are considered an important component of care for shoulder pain patients, although pain can
      be a limiting factor in the advancement of rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the addition of Biofreeze to an in-office group of shoulder pain patients to
      determine its impact on pain reduction. Methods: Patients 18-64 years old with mechanical
      shoulder pain who are candidates for standard shoulder therapy will be randomized into two
      groups (N=20). The Control group (N=10) will receive standard shoulder therapy alone while
      the Intervention group (N=10) will receive standard shoulder therapy plus Biofreeze just
      prior to initiating the in-office exercise program. Values of pain (NPRS) and disability
      (ASES) will be recorded at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Hypotheses will be addressed by
      repeated measures ANOVAs within and between group, time, and interaction main effects.
      Clinical Relevance: Progression of therapeutic exercises can be limited by pain and the
      associated disability. The ability to decrease shoulder pain and disability with a topical
      analgesic will allow health care professionals to advance patients through a therapeutic
      exercise program without the restriction of pain. In turn, patients will correct the
      underlying condition of their shoulder pain at a faster rate.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music on patients after surgery in
      the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). For many patients, surgery creates significant
      emotional stress and anxiety which can include discomfort or pain. Music therapy has proven
      to be a useful adjuvant in various inpatient and outpatient settings by providing a relaxing
      effect that decreases heart rate, blood pressure, and hormonal measures of stress. It has
      been shown that classical music can cause physiological and psychological differences in
      patient outcomes, but few studies have looked specifically at effects of jazz music. Some
      have argued that jazz may be too involved to provide the same relaxed state as classical
      music, but this may be due in part to the type of jazz played for the patient. It is our
      hypothesis that slow jazz music by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana
      Krall, Dave Brubeck, etc. will reduce measures of stress and anxiety in patients in the PACU
      following surgery for hysterectomy (laparoscopic or robotic) to a greater extent than the
      control group. Jazz music or ""no music"" will be played through headphones to participants in
      the study post-surgically while they are in the PACU and measures of stress, anxiety, and
      pain will be monitored.

      The gluteus medius (Gmed) and gluteus maximus (Gmax) muscles are important components in the
      treatment of many lower limb injuries. Recent studies have evaluated a myriad of exercises
      which activate the Gmed and Gmax, but limited research remains on exercises involving
      resistance and the role of the TFL. The purpose of this study is to evaluate Gmed, Gmax, and
      TFL percent maximal voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) and perceived exertion in healthy
      and low back pain patients while performing exercises with and without resistance. Methods: A
      convenience sample of healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with non-radicular low back
      pain will be recruited. Exclusionary criteria will include: current low back or lower
      extremity injury (healthy group), pregnancy, history of hip surgery, and radicular symptoms.
      Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity level of the gluteal muscles
      and TFL while performing a series of 8 exercises with and without Thera-Band Resistance
      Tubing and Stability Trainer. The maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) will be
      established for each muscle group and the order of exercises performed will be randomized to
      minimize the effect of fatigue. Following the completion of each exercise, the patient will
      rate their perceived exertion level on the Thera-Band Resistance Intensity Scale for
      Exercise (RISE). The EMG signals will be smoothed and rectified and analyzed using a
      root-mean-square algorithm. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study will allow
      clinicians to better prescribe exercises, proven to activate the gluteal muscles and limit
      the TFL involvement, in the treatment of low back pain.

      Epidural analgesia has proven to be an effective method for severe pain relief associated
      with labor and delivery. During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic and
      narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the
      baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs
      further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through
      the epidural catheter. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two
      medication mixtures believed to be successful in treating this type of pain associated with
      advanced labor. After this initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient may
      receive the other medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used at
      this institution for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The opioid
      (fentanyl) dose is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby. The other
      medication (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been used for
      pain relief. Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given epidurally
      in the doses used in this study has minimal, if any effect, on the blood pressure of the
      mother or of the baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history and labor
      progress relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding labor pain
      and side effects before and after the analgesic is administered. The primary objective is to
      determine which treatment regimen is more successful in abolishing breakthrough pain in
      advanced labor.

      Recent evidence demonstrates that perioperative pain continues to be poorly managed among
      ambulatory surgical patients. More importantly, few interventions that minimize postoperative
      pain have also shown to improve patient overall quality of post-surgical recovery. Ketorolac
      has been used to minimize perioperative pain despite the lack of evidence for its use when
      administered as a single dose preventive strategy.Ketorolac has also been associated with a
      higher incidence of perioperative hematomas and the need for surgical re-exploration after
      breast surgery.

      Systemic acetaminophen has become recently available in The United States. In contrast to
      ketorolac, systemic acetaminophen has not been reported to have adverse side effects on
      patients undergoing breast surgery. Although evidence suggests that a single dose
      perioperative acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain, it remains unknown if a single dose
      intravenous acetaminophen improves postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory
      surgery.

      The main objective of the current investigation is to evaluate the effect of a single dose
      systemic acetaminophen on postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory breast surgery.
      We also seek to determine if systemic acetaminophen would decrease postoperative pain and the
      time to hospital discharge in the same population.

      Significance: The current project evaluates a potential intervention to improve perioperative

      Background & study question:

      Strategies for post-operative pain control that make use of various different types of
      medicines are advantageous both for patient comfort and for minimizing the use of opioid pain
      medicines and their associated side effects, which include drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting.
      A key element of these strategies is wound injection with local anesthetic (numbing medicine)
      at the time of surgery. Local numbing procedures are used routinely in patients undergoing
      abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), most often with lidocaine or bupivacaine, which can last several
      hours. Multiple studies have shown that locally injected pain medicines achieve better pain
      control, less opioid use, and faster return to normal activities, such that the use of one of
      these local anesthetic medicines is the current standard of care.

      Exparel is an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine that can produce local pain relief
      for up to 72 hours. Studies have shown it to provide better post-operative pain control and
      decreased use of opioid medications when compared to patients who did not receive any local
      numbing agents. Exparel has been used successfully in a variety of surgical settings,
      including open colon surgery, laparoscopic gall bladder removal, abdominoplasty, and breast
      augmentation. Its effectiveness has by and large been established in comparison to no local
      anesthetic. In this study, we seek to investigate the benefit of Exparel compared to standard
      bupivacaine infiltration in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.

      Study design:

      Patients scheduled for abdominoplasty with the lead investigator will be offered inclusion in
      this study. Consenting patients will be randomly assigned to standard bupivacaine or Exparel
      by coin toss after their clinic visit. On the day of surgery, the only difference between
      patients assigned to one arm or the other is the local anesthetic used. The surgery itself
      and plan for general anesthesia will be similar. Both groups will have the same pain
      medicines available after surgery.

      Patients will be given a form on which to record twice-daily pain ratings and opioid narcotic
      needs for 3 days after surgery. For patients admitted after surgery, oral and IV narcotic use
      will be collected from their inpatient medical record.

      The primary outcome of interest is daily and cumulative pain scores through 3 days. A
      secondary endpoint is daily and total opioid use over 3 days. Additional measures include the
      time to first post-operative use of opioid medication and incidence of any adverse side
      effects.

      Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care and accounts
      for over 3.7 million physician visits/year in the U.S. alone. Ninety percent of adults will
      experience low back pain in their lifetime, 50% will experience recurrent LBP, and 10% will
      develop chronic pain and related disability.

      While there is growing evidence for the clinical effectiveness of alternative and
      complementary therapies to treat low back pain, little is known on the physiologic
      consequences and effects of these treatments. Further, additional data is needed to
      understand how these different treatment techniques effect clinical changes in pain and
      disability. The lack of empirical data hinders acceptance by the wider scientific and
      health-care communities, and it also limits the development of rational strategies for using
      alternative and complementary therapies.

      Background:

      - Small differences in genes may alter responses to drugs. One gene that has different forms
      is the mu opioid receptor gene. People with one form of this gene are more sensitive to
      alcohol. People with a different form are sometimes more sensitive to pain. Morphine and
      other prescription pain pills produce pain relief by acting at the mu opioid receptor.
      Researchers want to see the effect of morphine on brain reward and subjective effects.
      Morphine is a strong but short-acting pain medication that is sometimes used for anesthesia
      during surgery.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the effect of morphine on brain measures of dopamine release using imaging.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 21 and 55 years of age who have previously taken pain pills prescribed
      to treat pain from a medical or dental procedure.

      Design:

        -  This study has a screening phase and a study phase. The screening phase involves one or
           two visits of 5 to 6 hours. The study phase consists of 4 study visits. Each study visit
           will take about 8 hours.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history and physical exam.
           They will be asked about drinking and drug-taking history, and any family history of
           alcoholism or drug abuse. Blood, urine, and breath samples will be collected.

        -  During the first study visit, an MRI scan may be performed, questionnaires completed,
           and a blood sample collected for genetic testing.

        -  During study visit 2, participants will test their pain sensitivity by placing one hand
           in cold water. Pupil diameter will be measured after the sensitivity test. After a blood
           sample is taken, participants will receive the morphine or a salt solution. The
           sensitivity test and pupil diameter test will be repeated. Final blood samples will be
           collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.

        -  During study visits 3 and 4, participants will receive morphine or a salt solution
           during a PET scan. Questionnaires to assess subjective effects will be administered.
           Final blood samples will be collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.

        -  Participants will stay in the clinic until the effects of the drug have worn off after
           study visits 2, 3, and 4.

        -  About 1 week after the study session, participants will have a follow-up phone call.

      The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with laser therapy in pediatric patients
      undergoing renal biopsies will improve patient satisfaction of the overall procedure. In this
      study, the participant will receive a laser acupuncture treatment targeting either kidney
      acupoints or targeting ""sham"" points not associated with the kidney; the participant will not
      get both. Both treatment sessions are given by a certified medical acupuncturist. The patient
      will still receive standard pain control protocols with anesthetic medications like lidocaine

      procedure. All medication will be administered without regard for which group the participant
      has been randomized, as the treatment team will also be blinded.

      Hypothesis:

      We will test the hypothesis that treatment with laser acupuncture in patients undergoing
      renal biopsies will improve patient satisfaction of the overall procedure.

      Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether the use of laser acupuncture improves patient's overall
      satisfaction of renal biopsy.

      Spinal cord injury neuropathic pain (SCI-NP) is a common problem, and when severe, is one of
      the most problematic of secondary conditions that is minimally to modestly responsive to
      currently available treatments. It is usually described as burning or stabbing, and is
      located at or below the level at which their sensation changes from normal to impaired;
      persons with no feeling at all in their legs for example can experience pain in the legs. The
      purpose of this project is to further investigate the use of a novel visual stimulation
      treatment; a technique that has shown benefit in other populations with chronic pain
      secondary to deafferentation. To accomplish this, a novel treatment - virtual reality (VR)
      walking - will be examined. Should this treatment show benefit, a portable, accessible means
      of treatment will be available for persons with SCI and for whom transportation to health
      care providers is often difficult.

      Prescription opioid misuse is a significant public health problem as well as a patient safety
      concern. Primary care providers are the leading prescribers of opioids for chronic pain, yet
      few providers follow standard practice guidelines regarding assessment and monitoring. The
      investigators propose a novel system change in delivery of primary care services to decrease
      misuse of and addiction to prescription opioids for patients with chronic pain.

      The proposed intervention for the overall project includes a nurse-managed registry for
      planning individual patient care and conducting population-based care for a population of
      patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. Academic detailing to clinicians is another
      effective way to improve care. Finally, the researchers will create a knowledge management
      tool to facilitate guideline adherence. This tool will be accessible via an internet link,
      and will include validated instruments to assess patient status and also to facilitate
      physician adherence to suggested monitoring.

      The objectives of this study are, to test the effectiveness of Valproic Acid (VPA) in the
      prevention of chronic neuropathic and post-amputation pain, as well as to further define the
      underlying inflammatory and epigenetic mechanisms that lead to the development of such
      chronic pain.

      HYPOTHESES AND QUESTIONS

      Hypothesis 1: The use of oral valproic acid in combination with regional anesthesia in
      surgical limb-injury patients will decrease the incidence of chronic nerve injury and
      post-amputation pain.

      Goal 1: In a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial,
      investigators will determine if oral VPA added to regional anesthesia and standard
      perioperative management will reduce the incidence of nerve injury and post-amputation pain
      when compared with regional anesthesia alone.

      Hypothesis 2: The transition from acute to chronic pain is mediated via epigenetic mechanisms
      (differential DNA methylation) in genes involved in nociception.

      Goal 2: Investigators will analyze the DNA methylation patterns of patients with different
      types of neuropathic and post-amputation pain and determine if they are altered by VPA.

      Pain relief after cesarean delivery can be provided in a few ways. Most commonly, certain
      medications called opioids, such as morphine, are given through the vein or into the muscle.
      However, a more effective way to give pain relief with fewer side effects (such as nausea and
      slowing your breathing) is to give opioids in the spinal space as part of the medications
      given for a cesarean delivery.

      For many years, the opioid of choice was morphine due to its long anesthetic effect and
      acceptable side effect profile. A nation-wide disruption in the supply of preservative-free
      morphine has made it necessary to look for alternatives. Many institutions worldwide have
      used another opioid, called hydromorphone, in the spinal space for over a decade. This drug
      has a very good safety and side effect profile and has been used at the investigators'
      institution for more than a year. Of interest, while a number of different doses of
      hydromorphone have been used, there have been very few studies to evaluate the best dose for
      providing good pain relief with minimal side effects. The goal of this study is to find the
      best dose of spinal hydromorphone for women undergoing cesarean delivery.

      Chronic pain is a significant public health problem that affects over 116 million Americans,
      costs $600 billion annually, and is unequally borne by people in low-income brackets,
      especially ethnic minorities. Many individuals also have health literacy deficits (difficulty
      understanding their illness and difficulty navigating the health care system for treatment)
      putting them at a greater disadvantage. Treatment usually relies on expensive medical
      interventions that often have negative side-effects. Psychosocial treatments, like Pain
      Education and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), show promise, but are usually unavailable.
      Clinicians are poorly equipped to provide psychosocial treatments to patients with low health
      literacy. CBT has not been adapted and supported for use in individuals with low health
      literacy, and even educational materials are often poorly adapted for their needs.

      To address this problem, the PI completed a small trial showing benefits from health
      literacy-adapted pain education and CBT groups for chronic pain in a population with low
      income and low health literacy. Patients in both treatments reported lower pain by the end of
      treatment, and the effects were maintained at one year. Patients in the CBT group also
      reported less depression. The current study uses a larger sample, and directly compares these
      psychosocial treatments to medical treatment-as-usual to seek better evidence for or against
      their widespread use in community settings.

      Our research questions:

        1. In people with chronic pain and low income and/or low literacy, does participating in a
           health-literacy-adapted psychosocial treatment improve their pain and interference in
           daily activities due to pain by the end of treatment when compared with a group
           receiving typical medical care, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?

        2. Does participation in the CBT pain management group improve symptoms of depression
           better than a pain education group by the end of treatment, and are these effects
           maintained 6 months later?

      In partnership with a federally qualified health center, we will enroll 294 patients with
      chronic pain. Main outcomes will be patient-reported pain intensity, pain interference,
      depression, and perceived change. From an earlier trial, we expect that our participants will
      be ~75% female and ~70% African American, and will have low literacy and low income (~60% in
      the low 15% nationally on word reading, and 90% at or below the poverty threshold).

      care or 2) usual care with acupuncture offered (125 in each group). The primary outcome
      measure will be change in daily pain intensity. Data on other symptoms, such as nausea,
      vomiting, anxiety, and depression, as well as functionality and quality of life will be
      collected in person, on a web-based survey, or via telephone follow-up. The aims of the study
      are to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage pain and other symptoms among
      hospitalized patients; to evaluate the impact of acupuncture on patient satisfaction among
      hospitalized patients; and to estimate costs and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture among a
      subset of hospitalized patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to hospitalized patients receiving usual care
      alone, hospitalized patients receiving acupuncture will have:

        1. decreased pain severity

        2. higher patient satisfaction

      Laparoscopic surgery for gastric reduction is frequently associated with high levels of
      postoperative pain. Postoperative pain is very often treated with opioids. However large
      doses of opioids can result in respiratory depression with hypoxemia especially in high risk
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea. since a large group of patients undergoing surgery for
      gastric reduction surgery also have obstructive sleep apnea, it is expected that these
      patients are also at high risk for postoperative respiratory depression and hypoxemia.

      Intraoperative ketamine has been used as an effective multimodal agent to reduce
      postoperative pain. However, ketamine alone has not been examined to improve postoperative
      pain outcomes in patients undergoing gastric reduction surgery. More importantly, it is
      unknown if the use of intraoperative ketamine can lead to better overall quality of recovery
      in the same patient population. In addition, ketamine has been shown to improve ventilation
      but it remains to be determined if the intraoperative use of ketamine will result in less
      postoperative hypoxemic events.

      The main objective of the current investigation is to examine the effect of intraoperative
      ketamine on postoperative quality of recovery after gastric reduction surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects receiving ketamine will have a greater global quality
      of recovery score than the ones receiving saline.

      Background: Facet interventions are the second most commonly performed procedure in pain
      clinics throughout the U.S, including in the military. Currently, there is no clear consensus
      regarding whether intra-articular (IA) blocks or medial branch blocks (facet joint nerve;
      MBB) are the best way to diagnose and treat facetogenic pain, or even whether or not to
      perform diagnostic/ prognostic blocks.

      Hypothesis: IA blocks will provide better relief than MBB, but MBB may better select patients
      for radiofrequency denervation.

      Purpose: Objective 1: Determine which ""prognostic"" block is the best predictor for RF
      denervation outcome; Objective 2: To determine whether adding steroids to IA or MBB may
      provide intermediate or long-term benefit to a subset of individuals.

      Research Design: Randomized, comparative-effectiveness study

      Methodology /Technical Approach: A total of 225 patients with non-radicular chronic low back
      pain (LBP) with suspected facetogenic etiology will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of
      3 groups:

      Group 1 will receive IA blocks with steroids and LA Group 2 will receive MBB with steroids
      and LA Group 3 will receive MBB with only saline

      Those individuals who obtain significant ( 50% in groups 1 and 2,3) but temporary (<
      1-month) relief will undergo radiofrequency (RF) denervation at their 1-month follow-up. In
      group 3, those patients who do not experience pain relief at 1-month will undergo RF
      denervation regardless of the pain relief they experience (as many practitioners in the
      military and civilian practices do without diagnostic blocks).1-3 Participants in Groups 1
      and 2 who experience prolonged relief from their diagnostic/ therapeutic blocks with LA and
      steroids will not undergo RF denervation until their pain returns. Those individuals who
      experience prolonged relief lasting > 6 months will be given the option of repeating the
      diagnostic/ therapeutic block. In Groups 1, 2 and 3 patients who experience prolonged relief
      from the diagnostic blocks, follow-up visits will be at 1-month, 3-months and 6-months after
      the block, or until their pain relief wears off. In those who undergo denervation based on a
      positive block, follow-ups will be performed 1, 3 and 6-months after the denervation provided
      they continue to experience significant (> 50%) relief at each follow-up. Those individuals
      who fail to experience significant relief after denervation will be unblinded and exit the
      study per protocol.

      Trigeminal neuralgia is a craniofacial pain syndrome that is typically characterized by
      unilateral severe, recurrent, electrical pain in one or more distributions of the trigeminal
      nerve. Current treatment strategies include oral medications as first line therapy with
      surgical interventions reserved for those patients who are refractory to medications or
      unable to tolerate medication side effects. Despite these current treatment options, many
      patients continue to have symptoms. Ultrasound-guided trigeminal nerve block allows for fine
      adjustment of the needle tip and direct observation of the medicine.

      Local anesthetic and steroids have been successfully used for diagnostic and or therapeutic
      nerve pain with great success. Steroids can be short or long acting in duration with varying
      side effects. If there exists a difference in duration of action, using the longer acting
      drug will provide a greater period of symptom relief for the patient and may allow the
      patient to undergo fewer interventional procedures.

      The investigators hypothesize that in mastectomy patients with breast reconstruction, the
      addition of bupivacaine and botulinum toxin (BT) will result in better pain control in the
      acute and chronic setting, compared to traditional pain management techniques which rely
      almost exclusively on opioid analgesics and sedatives like diazepam (valium). This
      expectation is based on the fact that bupivacaine produces pre-emptive analgesia and BT will
      produce muscle relaxation, the combination of which will target different sites of pain
      generation, thus producing better analgesia. We also hypothesize that additional benefits may
      accrue from this regimen including decreased nausea and vomiting, sedation and constipation
      as a result of diminished opioid use1.

      The study comprises of a series of pupillary measurements using infrared pupillometry in
      patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery of any type.

      Infrared pupillometry will be used to assess whether a painful stimulus results in pupillary
      reflex dilation (PRD). The extend of the PRD may be an indicator how painful a stimulus is.
      This may help to predict the amount of discomfort a patient will be experiencing after
      emergence from general anesthesia.

      In addition to measuring the pupillary reflex dilation, we will also measure oscillations of
      pupil size before and after indiction of anesthesia, as well as during recovery. These
      spontaneously occuring oscillations in pupil size, also called hippus, appear to be sensitive
      to anesthetics and opioids. However, the effect of these drugs on hippus has not been
      systematically addressed.

      The aim of the study is

        1. to identify whether regional anesthesia techniques such as femoral and sciatic nerve
           blocks will block the PRD. This would allow assessment of block success in the
           anesthetized patient.

        2. to correlate the extent of the pupillary reflex dilation and hippus in the anesthetized
           patient during and at the end of surgery with early postoperative pain scores and
           subsequent analgesia requirements. Such correlation would allow to predict the amount of
           postoperative pain before the patients emerge from general anesthesia.

      The combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique has become increasingly popular for labor pain
      because of its rapid onset and superior first stage analgesia. However, increased risk for
      early profound fetal bradycardia (EPFB) following CSE continues to be a concern. Various
      factors are implicated in the etiology of EPFB but the cause is unknown. Ephedrine
      administration prior to CSE analgesia may help reduce the risk of EPFB, but to date, nobody
      has studied the impact of a single dose of intravenous (IV) ephedrine given at the time of

      This study will provide tools to develop and pilot an intervention for Functional Abdominal
      Pain (FAP) using a ten session intervention with children ages 5-8. Investigators will train
      the subjects to be ""Feeling and Body Investigators"". During treatment phases the following
      will occur 1) gather clues (learn), 2) investigate (experience: perform interoceptive mystery
      missions to explore a body sensation), 3) organize body clues (contextualize: recall other
      contexts that evoke similar sensations), and 4) go on increasingly daring missions
      (challenge: decrease avoidance and safety behaviors). The FBI intervention will be developed
      and refined in 26 child-caregiver dyads during the current R21 phase. In the R33 phase
      investigators will randomize 100 subjects with FAP to FBI or an active control group in order
      to conduct a pilot-test of the feasibility, acceptance, and clinical significance of FBI.
      Young children with FAP who complete the FBI early intervention will learn to experience
      changes in the viscera as fun and fascinating, rather than scary, and will develop new
      capacities for pain management, adaptive functioning, and emotion regulation. For the R21
      Phase (assessing initial feasibility) investigators hypothesize that  80% of participants
      enrolled in FBI will complete treatment and that  80% of participants will complete
      home-based practice assignments.

      Cervical radicular pain is a common, disabling problem, occurs in 83:100,000 individuals per
      year. Symptoms are most often caused by intervertebral disc herniation (21.9%) or central or
      foraminal stenosis from spondylosis (68.4%). Patients complain of pain in the head, neck,
      scapula or arm. The diagnosis of radicular pain is made clinically by history and physical
      examination, supported by imaging studies and electrodiagnostic tests. No study has compared
      the differences in pain, medication utilization, functional outcomes, or patient satisfaction
      between interlaminar and targeted epidural injections in the cervical spine. In theory, the
      technique of targeted epidural steroid delivery with a catheter has a lower risk of
      accidental vascular trespass or disc penetration during the procedure, and far less risk of
      dural penetration or spinal cord injury at rostral levels of the cervical spinal cord as
      compared with the interlaminar technique. The investigators hypothesize that this technique
      results in superior pain control, decreased medication use, improved function and fewer
      repeat injections. This data could improve patient safety and affect the evolving treatment
      guidelines for cervical epidural injections.

      The use of intrathecal opioids for analgesia in the setting of cesarean section has become
      standard obstetric anesthesia practice. Currently, two opioids are commonly used. These
      opioids are fentanyl and morphine (Duramorph). Intrathecal opioids are an excellent source of
      analgesia and act to reduce the stress response to surgery.

      Currently, most obstetric anesthesiologists use intrathecal morphine for analgesia after
      cesarean delivery. Morphine provides excellent analgesia for cesarean section. However, use
      of this medication is associated with side effects such as pruritus and nausea and vomiting.

      Recently, multiple obstetric anesthesia groups began to use intrathecal hydromorphone for
      cesarean delivery when morphine was unavailable. As groups began to use hydromorphone,
      retrospective data became available that demonstrated its safety and efficacy for use during
      cesarean section.

      In order to fully elucidate the analgesic and side effect properties of hydromorphone for
      cesarean delivery, a prospective randomized, double blind study comparing morphine and
      hydromorphone is necessary. The investigators need to understand whether hydromorphone is as
      effective as morphine for analgesia after cesarean section, and whether it is associated with
      fewer or more side effects. The results of the study will allow providers to make educated
      decisions to better care for their patient.

      Patients undergoing major spinal surgery continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain
      during the first 2-3 days following the operative procedure. Pain complicates the recovery
      process, despite the routine practice of using potent opioid analgesics. The primary reason
      that pain is poorly controlled in patients undergoing major surgery is that most
      commonly-used opioids only produce analgesia for 2-4 hours. The intermittent use of these
      drugs results in periods of time when a patient will experience discomfort (at which time a
      nurse administers more drug or the button on a patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) system is
      pressed to deliver more medication). The use of a long-acting opioid may be advantageous in
      the perioperative setting. Methadone is an opioid that has a median duration of analgesia of
      24-36 hours. Therefore, a single dose administered in the operating room may reduce the need
      for pain medication and improve pain control for the first few postoperative days. The aim of
      this randomized clinical trial is to examine the effect of methadone (compared to
      hydromorphone) on postoperative pain management in patients undergoing major spine surgery

      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is an important problem, and treatments are often prescribed in
      a ""trial and error"" fashion. Clinicians prescribe a treatment to a patient and then wait and
      see if the treatment is successful. If the treatment is unsuccessful, they will try a
      different treatment. The disadvantage to this method is that it may take a long time to find
      a successful treatment.

      The purpose of the PREEMPT Study is to test whether using a mobile phone application
      (""Trialist app"") that allows patients and their health care providers to run personalized
      experiments comparing two pain treatments is more effective than usual care. Patients
      download the app, and working with their clinicians, set up a personalized trial that makes
      sense for them. Every day they answer questions to track levels of pain and side effects of
      treatment, such as fatigue and constipation. Once the personalized trial has ended, the
      responses to these daily questions on each treatment will be compared. During a regular
      clinic visit, the patient and the clinician will review visual displays of the results to
      facilitate treatment decision-making. Approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in the
      study. Half the patients will use the app and review results with the clinician, and half the
      patients will continue with their regular care (i.e., will not use the app). The two groups
      will be compared to see if using the app is successful in improving long term pain outcomes.
      The goal of the intervention using the Trialist app is to help patients engage actively and

      Low back pain is a problem which affects up to 70-80% of people in their lifetime. In the
      United States, it is estimated that the total direct and indirect costs of low back pain
      combined ranges from $19.6 to $118.8 billion. Recent studies have shown the importance of the
      gluteal musculature in the treatment of low back pain. It was found that the gluteus maximus
      (Gmax) is significantly more active in a low back pain population compared to a healthy
      population, indicating the low back pain population relied on the Gmax to fire more to
      overcome the gluteal weakness. A new approach to treating musculoskeletal conditions is a
      taping technique designed to target muscles and lymphatic system. Limited research is
      available for the treatment of specific conditions, including low back pain, but it is
      theorized to inhibit or facilitate the muscle, improve blood flow, reduce pain, and improve
      joint alignment. Methods: The purpose of this study is to determine the immediate and delayed
      effectiveness of Cramer Sports Motion Tape on Gmax and lumbar paraspinal activation in a
      chronic mechanical low back pain population. A convenience sample of 20 new patients with
      current, chronic low back pain, no current neurologic signs or symptoms, no previous spinal
      surgery, no corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks, and who are not pregnant will
      be recruited for this study. Patients will sign an informed consent, complete all initial
      paperwork. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity level of the Gmax
      and lumbar paraspinals (LP). The MVIC will be estimated for each muscle group and the patient
      will perform a series of 4 randomized exercises, 5 repetitions each; Clams with Resistance,
      Standing Hip Abduction with Resistance, Sidelying Hip Abduction, and a forward bend. After
      each exercise the patient will rate ""How hard they are working"" on the RISE scale. Following
      the initial test, Cramer Sports Motion Tape will be applied to the gluteal and low back
      area. After the tape is applied, the EMG exercise protocol will be repeated. The tape will be
      left on until the patient returns for their next appointment, within 24 to 48 hours, where
      they will have a delayed post-test. Patients will rate their pain, surface electrodes will be
      applied to the previous testing sites, and MVIC will be retested for each muscle group. The
      patient will perform the same protocol that was performed in the initial testing session. The
      EMG signals will be smoothed, rectified and analyzed using a root-mean-square algorithm. The
      investigators will use visual onset and offset of the EMG signal amplitude to select the
      middle 3 trials. Average activation and peak activation will be determined and compared to
      the MVIC for each muscle group, and expressed as a %MVIC. This will allow %MVIC to be
      compared and rank order among groups and muscles.

      Cervical pain is a condition that affects 14.6% of all adults annually. Of this annual
      prevalence, 37.3% experience persistent neck pain with periodic recurring episodes. The
      purpose of this study is to compare muscle activation patterns of the cervical musculature
      during exercises with elastic versus manual resistance in a neck pain and asymptomatic
      populations. Methods: A convenience sample of 15 healthy, physically active participants and
      15 current patients diagnosed with non-radicular cervical pain will be recruited.
      Exclusionary criteria will include: current cervical or upper extremity injury (healthy
      group), history of neck surgery, corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks, and
      radicular signs or symptoms. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity
      level of the bilateral SCM, AS, Cervical Paraspinal (CP), and the Upper Trapezius (UT)
      muscles while performing a series of 6 exercises with elastic resistance using Thera-Band
      Resistance Bands and manual resistance. The area will be prepped and surface electrodes
      placed on the corresponding muscles. The movement will be standardized by using the peak
      activation (PA) of each muscle during full flexion-extension movement to create a percentage
      of peak activation (%PA). The testing battery will consist of 6 exercises with elastic
      resistance and manual resistance, totaling 12 different trials. Each trial will involve 5
      repetitions, each held for 5 seconds. The exercises will include cervical: extension,
      flexion, left rotation, right rotation, left side bending, and right side bending. The men
      will use the green and women will use the red Thera-Band Resistance Band. The order of
      exercises will be randomized in to two parts to minimize the effect of fatigue. First,
      cervical flexion and extension with manual and elastic resistance will be randomized.
      Secondly, the remaining 8 exercises will be randomized. Following each exercise, the patient
      will rate their perceived level of exertion on the Thera-band Resistance Intensity Scale for
      Exercise (RISE).

      Some patients have respiratory depression (decreased breaths per minute) after surgery.
      Acetaminophen, an FDA approved pain medication, may prevent this problem. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if acetaminophen decreases respiratory depression after surgery. The
      investigators will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of acetaminophen.

      Patients having elective major abdominal surgery are being asked to participate in this
      research study. If eligible, a patient will have their baseline tidal volume (amount of air
      moved into or out of the lungs) and vital capacity (how much air the lungs are capable of
      holding) measured using a spirometer (apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and
      expired by the lungs) measured before surgery. Three questionnaires will also need to be
      completed before surgery.

      The patient will then be randomized, like flipping a coin, to receive either Acetaminophen or
      placebo (inactive substance) as an infusion throughout surgery and for the first two days
      thereafter. Neither the patient nor his or her physician will know if the patient is assigned
      to study drug or placebo. Regardless of study assignment, both groups will receive standard
      pain management medications and sedation.

      After surgery, the patient's blood pressure, activity, posture, respiratory rate, the
      electrical activity of the heart, oxygen saturation, tidal volume, minute ventilation and
      respiratory rate will be continuously monitored and recorded for 48 hours using a wireless
      pulse-oximeter and a respiratory volume monitor.

      48 hours after surgery the patient will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction
      questionnaire, which will allow the patient to rate the satisfaction with the treatment
      received for pain. The patient will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about recovery.

      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of three alternative methods of analgesia
      in patients undergoing complex liver resection surgery: 1) thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA),
      2) continuous paravertebral block (PVB) with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and 3)
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) alone. Regional anesthesia techniques such as TEA and PVB
      may improve recovery and decrease postoperative pain scores in addition to other benefits
      such earlier return of bowel function and shortened length of hospital stay, although some
      practitioners have voiced concerns about the safety and efficacy of these techniques in
      patients after liver resection who may develop postoperative coagulation abnormalities. The
      investigators plan to enroll a total of 150 patients (adults >/= 18 years of age who meet
      study criteria) scheduled for complex liver resection surgery in this study, who will then be
      randomized into 50 patients per arm of the study (3 total arms). Postoperative pain scores
      will be collected in PACU and throughout the patient's hospital stay as well as routine blood
      tests including complete blood count, coagulation labs (PT/INR, aPTT) and serum creatinine to
      measure renal function. The study team will also collect additional data prospectively on all
      patients enrolled in the study; these parameters will include age, sex, type of operation
      performed, length of operation, volume of intraoperative blood loss, volume of intraoperative
      fluid administration including blood products, daily postoperative intravenous fluid
      administration, length of time to first feeding, day of epidural catheter removal, length of
      hospital stay and incidence of major postoperative complications (surgical, respiratory,
      cardiac, renal, etc.). Once primary and secondary data points are obtained, the data will
      undergo rigorous statistical analysis using the appropriate statistical techniques to
      determine the outcomes. The investigators propose that epidural and/or paravertebral
      analgesia may improve recovery times and decrease hospital length of stay, which would be
      beneficial for the patient as well as decrease hospital costs. In addition, if better
      postoperative pain management scores can be achieved with epidural or paravertebral
      analgesia, and no significant prolonged postoperative coagulopathy is associated with
      patients undergoing major hepatic resection surgical procedures, these regional analgesia
      strategies can be considered a safe option for pain management in this patient population.

      Subjects are being asked to participate in this study because they have an arm or leg
      amputation and have developed pain related to a neuroma (an ongoing localized pain related to
      a cut nerve ending).

      We are studying two different types of surgery to treat the neuroma pain. Today there are
      many surgical options reported which often means that there is no one best treatment. The
      surgery that shows the best success so far, involves cutting out the scarred nerve ending
      (neuroma) and burying the freshly cut nerve ending in a nearby muscle. Recently, a new
      surgery has been developed called targeted reinnervation (TR). This surgery connects these
      cut nerve endings to nerves going into nearby nonfunctional muscles. This surgery was
      developed to allow amputees to have better prosthesis control. By chance, neuroma pain
      improved significantly with TR. We, therefore, are conducting this clinical trial to evaluate
      which of these two surgeries best treats neuroma pain. We will ask all participants to fill
      out a questionnaire both before and after surgery. This will help us understand how a neuroma
      affects the quality of life of amputees and will allow us to understand which surgery leads
      to the best improvement in neuroma pain.

      In order to confirm the presence and location of the neuroma before surgery, a magnetic
      resonance image (MRI) will be performed. Taking these pictures requires subjects to lie still
      for a short period of time but does not involve any invasive procedures. After surgery, the
      MRI will be done again, this time to see if the nerve shows signs of scarring.

      Prescription drug abuse represents a major healthcare problem, with treatment costs reaching
      billions of dollars annually in the United States alone. Today opioids are commonly
      prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain and are only partially effective for short-term pain
      relief. Whereas opioids are initially part of the solution for pain, it eventually often
      turns to be a problem in patient with chronic pain. Long-term treatment with opioids can be
      complicated by development of tolerance, dependency, addiction, abnormal pain sensitivity,
      hormonal changes, and immune modulation. Unfortunately, the chronic use of anti-inflammatory
      drugs is associated with a marked increase in adverse effects.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether systemic administration of lidocaine
      provides effective pain relief in opioid dependent chronic pain patients. Investigators
      intend to demonstrate that lidocaine infusion can improve pain relief and physical function
      in opioid dependent patients, thus improving compliance and patient satisfaction, which may
      potentially help wean patients off narcotics. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
      decrease opioid dependence in chronic pain patients by using lidocaine infusion.

      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the most common pain condition in the military, causing
      substantial physical and psychological suffering, reduction in force readiness, and high
      economic cost. Yoga has been studied in 10 RCTs in civilian populations with cLBP suggesting
      it may be effective in reducing pain intensity, improving back-related function, and lowering
      pain medication use. Multiple differences exist between civilian and military populations
      with cLBP, making it necessary to adapt and test yoga for cLBP in military populations. This
      study's primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga for reducing pain in military
      personnel and Veterans with cLBP through a structured, reproducible 12-week series of hatha
      yoga classes, supplemented with home practice, compared to an education group. Additionally,
      the enormous mental health burden often shouldered by returning military personnel presents
      another important distinguishing factor. Thus, the study's secondary aim is to assess yoga's
      capacity to reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The third aim is to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of yoga for cLBP at 3 months and 6 months from the perspective of the
      provider, the Veteran, and the Veterans Health Administration. The fourth and final aim is to
      evaluate the effect of back pain and yoga on marital and family functioning. The proposed RCT
      will (1) establish a structured reproducible yoga protocol uniquely suited to Veterans
      populations with cLBP; (2) develop web-based delivery systems to assist Veterans in yoga home
      practice; (3) increase our knowledge of the feasibility and impact of yoga for Veterans' cLBP
      and psychological comorbidities. These results will help determine whether yoga is an

      and finally determine if a pro-inflammatory environment makes patients susceptible to chronic
      pain after surgery and can dexamethasone alter this environment. Patients undergoing total

      Peripheral nerve blocks have been well studied in the literature with generally good results
      for controlling post operative pain following orthopaedic surgery. Regional anesthesia has
      many benefits. It provides excellent intraoperative anesthesia and muscle relaxation as well
      as analgesia that continues into the post-operative period. These regional blocks are also
      effective in controlling pain in the immediate post-operative period. However, as the block
      wears off, patients begin experiencing increased pain. Compared to patients treated without
      regional blocks, these patients will often experience a ""rebound pain""--pain occurring 12-24
      hours after surgery that is subjectively worse than that in patients treated without regional
      blocks. Therefore, the investigators propose to use a continuous infusion of anesthetic in
      order to provide sustained pain control post-operatively. Preoperatively, patients will be
      randomized into a single shot peripheral nerve block versus a continuous infusion of
      peripheral nerve block. Post-operatively, pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue
      Scale (1-100) prior to being discharged from PACU. Time to discharge and amount of pain
      medication taken will be recorded. Patients will be contacted at certain time intervals
      postoperatively to assess their pain scale and pain medication intake. Patients will be seen
      for routine post-operative follow-up visits where they will be assessed for satisfaction,

      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit, if any, of buffering lidocaine (adding
      sodium bicarbonate) when used for local anesthesia prior to percutaneous breast needle core
      biopsies. The medicine doctors use to reduce the pain of breast biopsies, lidocaine, can
      cause pain for approximately 15 seconds until the numbing effect begins. It is possible that
      this pain is caused because lidocaine is acidic. Some physicians believe that reducing the
      acidity of lidocaine by mixing it with sodium bicarbonate will reduce the initial pain of
      injecting the lidocaine. Both approaches - injecting 1% lidocaine alone and injecting 1%
      lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate - are used as routine standard of care by
      radiologists today. The purpose of this study is to determine if either approach is more
      comfortable for patients having breast procedures.

      The aim of the study is to compare the safety & efficacy of low dose ketamine and morphine
      versus morphine alone for acute generalized pain in the Emergency Department (ED). The
      investigators are also interested to investigate whether low-dose ketamine is a safe and
      effective alternative option to opioids for the acute treatment of pain in the Emergency
      Department.

      The agents that are available in the department includes acetaminophen, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) and opioids. In most cases, acetaminophen and NSAIDS are not
      adequate to manage acute pain crisis. There is also heightening concerns for increased opioid
      use or abuse by patients. Since the HCAPHS survey includes various questions which inquires
      about patient perception of pain management in the department, the investigators are
      interested in investigating the safety and efficacy of low-dose ketamine to as an alternative
      method to opioids for the acute management of pain. There has been limited, mostly
      observational pilot studies, published in the literature. Limited data in the literature have
      reported the incidence of nausea and vomiting ranged from 3-13%. All published literature
      administered low-dose ketamine as an intravenous push. To the best of our knowledge our study
      would be the first study to administer low-dose ketamine as a short bolus infusion to
      mitigate the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The investigators believe our study would
      provide important scientific data to fill the theoretical gap that low-dose ketamine at
      0.3mg/kg/dose may be a safe and effective agent for acute pain management in an ED that is
      located in the center of a densely populated urban area.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a better method of administering pain
      medication prior to minimally invasive gynecological surgery so that postoperative pain
      and/or narcotic usage may be minimized. Currently, no standard of care exists regarding the
      use of local pain medications in minimally invasive gynecological surgery and practices vary
      widely among physicians, even within the same institution.

      The two methods of preemptive pain medication that this study will be looking at is the
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and the local injection of pain medication at the
      areas of the skin incisions. TAP block is a procedure performed by a specially trained pain
      management anesthesiologist in which there is an injection of a local pain medication into
      the abdominal wall, specifically in a space where the nerves that are responsible for
      postoperative pain reside. This procedure blocks the ability of the nerves to sense pain and
      has been found to be successful in decreasing postoperative pain in a number of procedures.
      The local injection of pain medications at the incision sites has also been found to be
      beneficial in decreasing postoperative pain. However, it is not known whether one method is
      superior to the other in decreasing postoperative pain or if the combination of both is best.

      Patients that chose to participate are randomly (by chance) assigned to one of three groups:
      1) TAP block with pain medication and local injection of normal saline (water) at the
      incision sites 2) TAP block with normal saline and local injection of pain medication at the
      incision sites or 3) TAP block with pain medication and local injection of pain medication at
      the port sites. These procedures are performed while the patient is asleep. Patients will be
      asked to record their level of pain on a standardized pain scale at one hour, six hours, and
      twenty-four hours after the surgery. All patients are provided with standard postoperative
      pain medications as needed.

      The hypothesis is that patients receiving both TAP block and local injection of pain
      medication at the port sites will have less pain postoperatively and require a smaller amount
      of narcotics than those that receive either the TAP block or local injection of pain
      medication alone.

      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is one of the most common and disabling conditions among US
      military Veterans. Although physical activity can improve cLBP outcomes, the majority of
      Veterans with cLBP are inactive. Therefore the VA is in need of effective programs that can
      help older Veterans with cLBP to increase their physical activity and improve associated
      outcomes. This is particularly relevant for older Veterans with cLBP who are at greater risk
      for functional limitations. The proposed project will be a pilot study of a telephone-based
      physical activity program or physical activity combined with cognitive behavioral pain
      management for older adult Veterans with cLBP. Older Veterans are of particular interest
      because prior studies of physical activity for cLBP have not addressed this vulnerable
      patient group. This study will also inform the VA about whether certain patients with cLBP,
      who have greater pain sensitivity, may benefit from other treatment to supplement a physical
      activity program.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of combining two interventions already in
      use at some institutions for reducing post-operative pain following tonsillectomy or
      adenotonsillectomy. The standard of care at most institutions is to leave the tonsillectomy
      wound bed exposed to heal on its own over one to two weeks. At many institutions, surgeons
      inject or topically apply local anesthetics such as bupivacaine hydrochloride to the
      tonsillectomy wound bed to help reduce post-operative pain. At other institutions, surgeons
      apply a layer of fibrin sealant, which is derived from the proteins that help form blood
      clots in blood, to the tonsillectomy wound bed in order to cover the site and reduce
      irritation and exposure of the wound bed. Use of fibrin sealant has the additional benefit of
      potentially reducing postoperative bleeding (hemorrhage) rates. Both the post-tonsillectomy
      use of bupivacaine (injection and topical) and the use of topical fibrin sealant application
      have been studied previously in the scientific literature; some studies show a clear benefit,
      others show no significant reduction in pain when they are used. No studies have documented
      harm. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of infusing bupivacaine
      anesthetic into the fibrin sealant prior to application to the tonsillectomy wound bed. In
      this way, the combined product would function as a sort of ""medicated bandaid"" covering the
      painful wound bed and slowly delivering an entirely safe total dose of bupivacaine into the
      wound bed to reduce post-operative pain. Parents will be provided post-operative pain
      measurements to complete during the first 10 postoperative days and return to the researchers
      for data analysis.

      Urodynamics are performed in the evaluation of urinary incontinence in women considering
      surgery or who have failed conservative therapies. Urodynamic testing requires the placement
      of small catheters into the bladder and the vagina or rectum. Many women experience anxiety
      around the procedure which can affect patient satisfaction. Lavender aromatherapy has been
      associated with decreased anxiety in a variety of clinical situations. The purpose of this
      study is to determine a difference in self-reported anxiety and pain levels before, during,
      and after multichannel urodynamics in patients given lavender aromatherapy versus placebo.
      This study design is a randomized control trial. Women scheduled for urodynamic testing at
      the Los Angeles County University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Urogynecology clinic will
      be invited to participate. Participants will be randomized to the aromatherapy or the placebo
      group after informed consent is obtained and immediately before undergoing multichannel
      urodynamics. The participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Survey (HADS)
      at baseline. They will be asked to rate their level of anxiety and pain before, during, and
      15 min after the study using the visual analogue scale and Wong-Baker pain scale. At the end
      the participants will also be asked to rate their satisfaction with the visit overall. The
      primary endpoint is defined as anxiety immediately after catheters are placed. Data will be
      entered into a coded database for analysis using the independent samples t test, the
      Mann-Whitney U test, and the chi square test. Intention to treat analysis will be used.

      Opioids are the most commonly utilized pharmacological treatment for moderate to severe pain.
      However, their clinical value is hindered by the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia
      (OIH). OIH manifests as heightened pain sensitivity, and is an increasingly challenging
      drawback to the efficacy of opioid treatment. Although the mechanism of action modulating OIH
      is not completely understood, previous animal studies suggest that this phenomenon is a
      result of proinflammatory responses. Thus, administering an adjunct anti-inflammatory agent
      may attenuate OIH. Minocycline is one such agent; it is a tetracycline derivative antibiotic
      that inhibits microglia activation, nitric oxide (NO) production, and the release of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In fact, recent evidence suggests that minocycline
      may attenuate the neuroinflammatory effects of opioids while enhancing their antinociceptive
      effects. Therefore, the investigators will determine if minocycline will mitigate OIH in

      The purpose of this study is to study acupuncture for the treatment of low back pain in the
      emergency department. Current treatments for low back pain in the emergency department
      generally include pills or injections of medications to treat pain and relax muscles.
      However, it is known that many of these medications have risks and toxicities which may limit
      their safe use in some patients. Therefore, new types of treatments are needed.

      Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in some form for centuries.
      In modern times, acupuncture has been studied for the long-term treatment of low back pain
      and some research suggests it may be effective. However, very little research has examined
      the use of acupuncture for immediate pain relief in the emergency department.

      This research will study a type of acupuncture called Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA).
      Battlefield acupuncture was designed by a physician in the US military with the purpose of
      providing immediate pain relief. It involves the placement of 5 small needles in each ear.
      The needles may be removed at any time. The hypothesis of this study is that battlefield
      acupuncture may improve mobility and pain of patients with low back pain in the emergency

      Postoperative pain is severe after major spine surgery. Opioids such as morphine and
      hydromorphone are routinely used for postoperative pain control. These drugs have significant
      side effects, most importantly respiratory depression, nausea, constipation and tolerance.
      Moreover, many spine surgery patients have used opioid pain medication for back pain long
      term, leading to pre-surgical opioid tolerance and increased postoperative pain. This has led
      to a search for adjuvant medications to reduce the use of opioids and reduce opioid mediated
      side effects and tolerance.

      Ketamine is an intravenous anesthetic with analgesic properties in subanesthetic doses.
      Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA
      receptors are involved in central pain sensitization via wind-up phenomenon and altered pain
      memory, a process which can be blocked by ketamine. NMDA receptor antagonists may prevent the
      development of tolerance to opioids and hyperalgesia. Ketamine has been safely used to
      decrease pain in numerous studies. Ketamine can also act as an antidepressant with hours of
      administration.

      Ketamine has rapid brain uptake and subsequent re-distribution with a distribution half-life
      of 10-15 minutes and an elimination half-life of 2 hours. Ketamine does not cause respiratory
      depression.

      Opioid pain medications such as morphine and dilaudid are commonly used in emergency
      departments to treat pain in patients. Physicians are familiar with the side effects of these
      medications; the most concerning of which is slowing or stopping a patient's breathing, as
      well as dangerously lowering their blood pressure. An alternative medication is ketamine.
      This medication is also commonly used in the emergency department, although it is typically
      used to help sedate patients for uncomfortable procedures. Ketamine has also been used for
      pain control, but in a much lower dosage that does not sedate patients. When used for
      analgesia, it has typically been administered in combination with opioid pain medications. To
      date, there is no study that looks at the effectiveness and safety of using a low dose
      ketamine alone in comparison to the use of morphine. The purpose of this study is to measure
      how well low-dose ketamine treats pain compared to morphine and to look at how often serious
      side effects are seen with each medication.

      usual (TAU) to reduce veterans' risk of persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following
      surgery. ACT has been shown to be effective in reducing chronic pain, anxiety and depression.

      This pilot study will establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of incorporating ACT
      into treatment as usual (TAU) to preoperatively target distress-based risk factors. Aim 1 is
      to establish the feasibility of successfully delivering ACT to at-risk veterans before and
      after surgery. Aim 2 is to test the preliminary efficacy of ACT on the length and/or amount
      of pain and opioid use after surgery. Veterans who are anxious or depressed before surgery
      will be randomly assigned to receive ACT plus TAU or TAU. Outcomes between the two groups
      will be compared. Aim 3 is to see if PROMIS modules, developed by the National Institute of
      Health, are useful for assessing pain and other symptoms in veterans. Findings from this
      study will be used to inform the design and implementation of a larger, well controlled,
      randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of ACT plus TAU for at-risk
      veterans.

      This study will take place at the Iowa City VA Health Care System (VAMC). Veterans scheduled
      for orthopedic or open abdominal surgery in 1 to 3 months who score high for anxiety or
      depression will be randomly assigned to attend a 1-day ACT workshop preoperatively, with an
      individualize ""booster"" session postoperatively, or to have TAU. Veterans who receive ACT and
      trainers who provide the treatment will be interviewed to identify barriers and facilitators
      to providing ACT to at-risk veterans before and after surgery. Other primarily outcomes are
      pain and opioid use after surgery. Factors that may affect these outcomes will also be
      measured, including anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, and use of other pain meds.

      The investigators expect to gain important knowledge about ways to best include ACT as part
      of routine care for veterans requiring surgery and about the preliminary efficacy of ACT for
      the prevention of persistent pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery.

      Background: Millions of pediatric patients undergo laparoscopic surgeries every year and many
      of them suffer significant pain and anxiety. Patient's anxiety correlates with the severity
      of pain and effective postoperative analgesia is necessary for optimal recovery. Single
      injections ultrasound guided rectus sheath blocks provide satisfactory postoperative
      analgesia after pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy, however they are short lived. Searching
      for a blocking agent that last long enough to outlast pain and has minimal side effects is a
      difficult task. Using a combination of drugs yielded mixed results. Few pediatric studies
      showed at best a weak trend in favor of clonidine prolonging analgesia after some blocks, but
      anxiolytic properties of clonidine were not investigated. This study will compare rectus
      sheath ropivacaine blocks with ropivacaine and clonidine blocks.

      Methods: One hundred pediatric patients (10-17 years old) scheduled for laparoscopic
      appendectomy will be double blinded and randomized to the two treatment groups: the
      Ropivacaine Group will receive ropivacaine 0.5% (10 ml) injected bilaterally in the posterior
      rectus sheath, at the umbilicus location, and Ropivacaine Clonidine Group will receive
      ropivacaine 0.5% (10 ml) and clonidine (2mcg/kg). Post-operative analgesia will be provided
      with ketorolac and acetaminophen around the clock, and morphine, or/and oxycodone as needed.
      The primary aim is to determine if ropivacaine combined with clonidine prolongs duration of
      paresthesia. The secondary aims are to determine if the use of clonidine decreases anxiety
      level, prolongs duration of analgesia, and decreases pain severity at umbilicus laparoscopic
      site, reduces the need for analgesics, improves satisfaction with pain control, and is
      associated with complications such as oversedation, hypotension, and bradycardia.

      Conclusions: Every hour of excellent analgesia count and a prolongation of block duration by
      at least 50% is clinical relevant. The investigators hypothesize that rectus sheath
      injections with ropivacaine and clonidine offer improved pain management compared to
      ropivacaine alone.

      This is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) regarding the conservative treatment of
      patellofemoral pain (PFP) with an impairment based rehabilitation program. Those with PFP can
      have a variety of impairments, such as knee and hip muscle weakness, poor movement patterns,
      weak core activation and muscle tightness. Several recent RCT trials have looked at treating
      single impairments, but to date no RCT have address individualized patient impairments during
      a rehabilitation program. Abnormal muscle firing patterns have also been identified during
      functional tasks; such as jogging, stair climbing, and performing a single leg squat.
      Conflicting studies have produced changes to the quadriceps and hip muscle firing patterns
      with those with PFP. The abnormal activation patterns has been suggested to be why
      strengthening programs alone do not improve movement patterns during functional tasks for
      those with PFP. Patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation (PENS) is a novel form of
      electrical stimulation that replicates proper firing patterns based off healthy
      electromyography patterns. The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of PENS
      with a impairment based rehabilitation program for the treatment of PFP. The rationale for
      this investigation is to assess the benefits of PENS with therapeutic exercise at improving
      altered firing patterns of the lower extremity muscles during functional tasks.

      Recently, several articles have suggested or reported that Adductor Canal Blocks (ACBs) offer
      adequate or equal analgesia and may promote better performance in early rehabilitation
      following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) when compared to the more commonly used Femoral Nerve
      Block (FNB). A common feature of these studies has been the use of moderate to high
      concentration local anesthetics (e.g. 0.2% or 0.5% Ropivacaine respectively) which when
      injected by a large motor nerve will inevitably cause weakness. However, the practice at our
      institution has long been a continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with a lower concentration
      local anesthetic (0.0625% Bupivacaine). Over the past several years the investigators have
      performed several thousand CFNBs using this technique which has offered the advantage of
      minimal motor weakness and adequate analgesia.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine if our established practice of using a low
      concentration continuous FNB inserted about 5cm caudal to the groin crease (the apex of the
      femoral triangle) using a low infusion rate of 2ml/hr is comparable to the emerging practice
      of inserting a Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block (CPNB) in the anatomic adductor canal (AC) -
      infusing at 4ml/hr. A secondary goal is to study the effect of cumulative volume of local
      anesthetic infused through a FNB when at a rate of 2ml/hr compared to a rate of 4ml/hr in the
      48-hour postoperative period.

      Definitions of the location of the adductor canal are debated heavily in literature, but they
      seem to agree that the middle 1/3 of the thigh contains the proximal AC while the distal 1/3
      of the thigh contains the adductor hiatus - the terminal end of the AC. Our study will
      require placement of the continuous ACB no more distal than 20cm cephalad to the superior
      pole of the patella due to placement prior to surgery and the need to keep the dressing out
      of the operative field. The CACB catheter will also not be placed any more proximal than 20cm
      distal to the ASIS. In addition to other exclusion criteria, these measurements will create
      an exclusion for patients with an iliac-to-patella distance less than 40cm. Iliac to Patella
      distance (IPD) will be measured at the pre-operative interview on the day of surgery with a
      measuring tape. External palpable landmarks of the Anterior superior iliac spine and the
      superior pole of the patella will be used.

      The primary outcome is based upon the ability to perform rehabilitation exercises
      postoperatively to the extent that criteria for discharge can be met. The primary outcome
      measured is the time at which a patient gains the ability to successfully perform a 75-feet
      unassisted walk. On the Day of Surgery (DOS), prior to any walking attempt, a secondary
      outcome measure will be to perform a 5-second sustained straight leg raise. Other secondary
      outcomes will be the number of days admitted prior to discharge, and average pain scores on
      DOS, Postoperative Day (POD) #1, and POD#2. The Day of discharge will also be used as a
      secondary outcome. Earlier discharge is becoming a goal of almost all healthcare systems to
      minimize costs.

      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be associated with a large amount of postoperative pain.
      This pain can oftentimes be severe enough to limit participation in physical therapy and
      ultimately delay discharge resulting in increased cost. Several strategies have been
      developed in an effort to decrease postoperative pain following TKA while maintaining lower
      extremity strength and maximizing participation in physical therapy. Recently, adductor canal
      blockade has gained popularity as it is reported to provide analgesia to the anterior knee
      without resulting in significant quadriceps muscle weakness. However, few studies have
      carefully evaluated the impact of volume of injection of local anesthetic into the adductor
      canal on motor weakness or pain control. The ability to achieve similar pain control with
      decreased volumes of local anesthetic would allow the surgery team to apply more local
      anesthetic to posterior knee structures. Decreased volumes of local anesthetic may also be
      associated with a decreased risk of local anesthetic toxicity. This study aims to carefully
      evaluate this relationship using a physical therapy evaluation method that relies on both
      motor strength and pain control. In addition, the investigators hope to carefully evaluate
      motor strength using a novel method of strength measurement in an effort to further evaluate
      the impact of volume of injection of local anesthetic into the adductor canal on motor
      strength.

      Chronic Pain (CP) management has increasingly utilized long-term opioid analgesic therapy, a
      change associated with increased opioid abuse (via greater exposure in vulnerable
      individuals), non-pain health consequences (hormone changes, falls), and a dramatic rise in
      opioid-related overdoses and deaths. Treatment strategies that minimize the need for chronic
      high-dose opioids are sorely needed. This project will test the novel hypothesis that
      effective pain relief can be achieved at lower opioid analgesic doses by increasing levels of
      endogenous opioids (EOs).

      The standard hospital procedure calls for the patient to undergo Interscalene block under
      ultrasound with or without nerve stimulation guidance prior to going to operating room (OR).
      The block utilizes a 40 ml mixture of 0.5% Ropivacaine and Lidocaine 1.5%. At this time the
      patient receives preliminary sedation with Midazolam 1mg IV and Fentanyl 50 mcg IV. The

      This study is being done to determine whether cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) on the
      medial branch nerves of the lumbar facet joint is effective for the treatment of low back
      pain. CRFA blocks the nerves that carry pain signals from joints in the lower back such that
      the brain does not receive the message that the low back is in pain. This technique is
      commonly performed by burning these nerves rather freezing them, but it is suspected that
      freezing them results in better pain relief. The CRFA blocks has been shown to effectively
      treat sacroiliac joint pain (a joint in the pelvis), which is another reason that it is
      suspected that CRFA will be effective when treating pain related to facet joints in the low
      back. We are performing this study in order to determine if that is the case.

      Many patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy experience moderate to severe pain
      after surgery. Finding ways to minimize postoperative pain are ideal. Dexamethasone is a
      corticosteroid that is commonly used to prevent and/or treat nausea and inflammation. The
      addition of higher doses of dexamethasone to nerve blocks, which are injections of local
      anesthetics into the upper shoulder area, has been shown to prolong block duration and reduce
      pain. However, it is unclear whether the advantage of longer pain relief outweighs patient
      dissatisfaction with the prolonged feeling of a numb arm. Furthermore, recent studies have
      shown that systemic, intravenously administered dexamethasone may similarly reduce pain
      levels when compared with dexamethasone in the block. In our study, the investigators propose
      to examine the effect of low-dose IV versus block dexamethasone on interscalene block
      duration in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. Most studies have used 4 mg or more.
      One study suggests that 1 mg may have the same effect as larger doses. Our aims are to
      determine whether the addition of low-dose dexamethasone to a local anesthetic in the block
      can prolong its duration, and whether there are differences in postoperative pain,
      consumption of painkillers, side effects, and satisfaction in patients who received IV or
      block dexamethasone. Patients (128 total) will be randomly assigned to either receive IV or
      block dexamethasone, and postoperative assessments (pain, painkiller use, side effects, block
      duration, satisfaction, complications) will be made via phone at 2, 3, 4 (if needed), and
      7-10 days after surgery. Results from this study will reveal whether patients prefer the

      Interstitial cystitis/Painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic debilitating condition
      that severely impacts between 2.7 and 6.5 percent of women in the United States. Despite its
      public health importance the pathogenesis of IC/PBS is not well understood and there is no
      consensus on the optimal treatment approach for this condition. Hydrodistention is the most
      commonly used therapy for this condition; but it is limited by severe immediate postoperative
      bladder pain and its short duration of action. It has been postulated that hydrodistention
      works by disrupting the sensory nerves within the bladder that may be contributing to bladder
      pain. Recent evidence has provided support for the use of preemptive pudendal nerve block as
      a way to blunt immediate postoperative pain. The investigators hypothesize that preemptive
      pudendal nerve block prior to hydrodistention will result in lower postoperative pain after
      hydrodistention compared to placebo. This is a prospective double- blinded randomized study
      and patients will be randomized to receive preemptive bilateral pudendal nerve block with
      either 1% lidocaine or placebo. Bladder pain will be compared at baseline, 2 hours, 2 weeks,
      6 weeks and 3 months using the Visual Analog Scale, O'Leary-Sant questionnaire and the Pelvic
      Pain Urgency and Frequency questionnaire.

      Laparoscopic and Robotic assisted hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that is a minimally
      invasive way in which to remove the uterus, which has less scarring and fewer complications.
      However, this procedure, much like its open-surgical counterpart, is often associated with
      significant post-operative pain. To augment this pain there are many different analgesic
      techniques available to offset pain. Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP)
      block is one such procedure involving the injection of a local anesthetic into the plane of
      the transversus abdominal muscle where the terminal branches of nerves lie. A similar, yet
      different analgesic approach is that of direct injection of local anesthetic into the
      incision by the surgeon during or just after surgical procedures. These two approaches have
      both been proven to decrease post-operative pain in patients for many procedures, but never
      compared to one another.

      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a prevalent condition among VA patients, but many current
      treatment options have limited effectiveness. In addition to chronic pain, people with
      chronic low back pain experience increased disability, psychological symptoms such as
      depression, and reduced health-related quality of life. This randomized controlled study will
      examine the impact of yoga therapy for improving function and decreasing pain in VA patients
      with chronic low back pain. Although not every VA patient with chronic low back pain will
      choose to do yoga, it is an inexpensive treatment modality that is increasingly appealing to
      many VA patients. If yoga is effective, it could become an additional low-cost option that
      the VA can offer to better serve Veterans with chronic low back pain.

      The TAP is a space between the muscle layers of the abdominal wall that houses nerves
      supplying the abdominal skin. Injecting the local anesthetic ropivacaine into this space will
      block these nerves and prevent pain following c-section. The investigators will compare two
      different approaches to injecting the local anesthetic in this space. Conventionally, the
      block is done after surgery is completed and the abdomen is closed. The anesthesiologist
      introduces a needle through the abdominal wall skin under ultrasound guidance to reach the
      TAP space and the drug is injected. Since the TAP layer is one of the deeper layers of the
      abdominal (belly) wall and is closer to the inside of the abdomen than to the outside (skin),
      injecting from the inner aspect of the abdominal wall during the surgery is easier and
      quicker to perform than the conventional block and does not require ultrasound guidance as
      there is no risk of injury to abdominal organs like the liver.

      With this research the investigators attempt to prove that surgically administered TAP blocks
      take 25% less time to perform compared to the conventionally administered TAP block for post
      cesarean section pain relief. Surgical TAP blocks are also more cost-effective as in addition
      to reduced OR time, they are safer and do not require skilled operator and specialized
      equipment. Secondary outcomes will include total time spent in the Operating room, presence
      and severity of postoperative pain, time to first request for pain medication, total
      postoperative narcotic consumption in 48 hours after surgery and side effects.

      Cervical incompetence complicates approximately 1 in 500 pregnancies . Those women with
      cervical incompetence are at risk for second trimester spontaneous abortion and preterm
      labor. Cervical cerclage reduces these risks but must be performed under general or neuraxial
      anesthesia. Some anesthesiologists prefer neuraxial anesthesia, as it reduces fetal exposure
      to medications and avoids the risks associated with loss of maternal airway reflexes under
      general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia, in particular, has the added advantage of being
      technically simple while still providing a rapid, dense sensory block. For cerclage
      placement, patients require a sensory block from the T10 to S4 dermatome in order to cover
      sensation from the cervix as well as the vagina and perineum. Patients presenting for
      cerclage under spinal anesthesia pose a dosing challenge given the physiologic changes
      associated with pregnancy. As women progress with their pregnancy, they require lower doses
      of intrathecal local anesthetic to achieve similar block level. Multiple studies have
      demonstrated that these changes start during the second trimester. Inadequate sensory
      coverage with a spinal anesthetic typically necessitates conversion to general anesthesia,
      causing additional time wasted and added risk to the patient and fetus. Anecdotally, this is
      the reason why some anesthesiologists choose general anesthesia for patients undergoing
      cerclage over a spinal anesthetic. As there is currently no literature determining the
      correct dosage for these patients, we propose a dose-response study to determine the ED90 of
      intrathecal lidocaine for adequate anesthesia for elective cervical cerclage placement.The
      findings of this study will help determine the minimum dose of intrathecal lidocaine
      necessary to provide adequate spinal anesthesia for cervical cerclage for 90% of women. This
      will help decrease the frequency of inadequate anesthesia for cervical cerclage.

      based dose of fentanyl (standard narcotic pain reliever), intravenous acetaminophen
      (non-narcotic pain reliever), and 60ml saline. Experimental group will receive weight based
      dose of fentanyl (standard narcotic pain reliever), intravenous acetaminophen (non-narcotic
      pain reliever), and dexmedetomidine (given as 1mcg/kg over 10 minutes Intravenous). The
      Patient will then awaken after surgery in post anesthetic recovery unit and be given a
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with hydromorphone (long acting narcotic pain
      reliever). The amount of hydromorphone used will be recorded by the PACU nurse to the
      electronic health record ( routine practice) in the two groups and compared for pain medicine
      requirements. Secondary endpoints will be Visual Analog Score (VAS) pain score, respiratory
      rate, heart rate, blood pressure oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. All will be recorded
      at 30,60,90,120 and 240 minutes in the electronic medical record in PACU and compared between
      the two groups . All the data - Intra operative and Post -operative - Post Anesthesia Care
      Unit ( PACU) data will be retrieved from the electronic Medical record (EMR). All
      intra-operative data is automatically computed into the patients EMR. All PACU data is
      routinely entered into the EMR by the PACU nurse including the PCA data.

      Chronic shoulder pain is a common, costly, and disabling problem for society. The
      identification of factors predictive of the development of chronic shoulder pain is necessary
      to develop innovative and effective treatments to reduce the societal impact of shoulder
      disorders. In previous work the investigators identified a genetic and psychological subgroup
      that robustly predicted heightened shoulder pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort and poor
      12 month shoulder pain recovery rates in a clinical surgical cohort. In this follow-up study
      the investigator proposes to test how interventions tailored to the high risk subgroup affect
      pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort.

      The optimal theorized match for the identified high-risk subgroup is a combination of
      personalized pharmaceutical and education interventions. This combined personalized
      intervention versus a placebo pharmaceutical and general education intervention group is the
      primary comparison of interest. Also, an evaluation of the individual effect of personalized
      pharmaceutical and educational interventions will be part of the study. Such comparisons will
      provide important information on what the active portion of the combined personalized
      intervention may be.

      Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem among US adults. Initial episodes tend to be
      self-limited (""acute""), but some people can progress to a state of persistent pain. Often
      termed ""chronic"" LBP (cLBP), this condition can cause prolonged difficulty with most daily
      activities, including job performance. This study will compare two approaches for preventing
      patients with acute LBP (aLBP) from developing cLBP using a pragmatic, cluster randomized
      trial. The first approach is to provide PCPs with information regarding a patient's risk of
      transitioning from aLBP to cLBP and to encourage PCPs to treat patients according to accepted
      clinical guidelines. The second approach is to provide the same risk information and have
      PCPs team up with physical therapists to deliver psychologically-informed physical therapy
      (PIPT) for those patients determined to be at high risk for transitioning to cLBP. The 1,860
      patients expected to be enrolled at five regional sites (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Boston,
      Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; Charleston, South Carolina; and Salt Lake City, Utah)
      will start the study when their LBP is in an acute phase. The study's primary aims are to
      compare the proportions of cLBP and measures of functional ability between the two groups at
      6 months. Secondary aims are to measure the referrals to physical therapists and specialists,
      opioid prescriptions, LBP-related x-rays or MRIs, surgeries, and other medical procedures
      during a 12-month follow-up period.

      clinical trial demonstration project that directly informs national trauma care system policy
      targeting injured patients with presentations of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
      related comorbidity. Each year in the United States (US), over 30 million individuals present
      to trauma centers, emergency departments, and other acute care medical settings for the
      treatment of physical injuries. Multiple chronic conditions including enduring PTSD, alcohol
      and drug use problems, depression and associated suicidal ideation, pain and somatic symptom
      amplification, and chronic medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease,
      diabetes, and pulmonary diseases) are endemic among physical trauma survivors with and
      without traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Evidence-based, collaborative care/care management
      treatment models for PTSD and related comorbidities exist. These care management models have
      the potential to be flexibly implemented in order to prevent the development of chronic PTSD
      and depressive symptoms, alcohol use problems, and enduring physical disability in survivors
      of both TBI and non-TBI injuries; care management models may also be effective in mitigating
      the impact of the acute injury event on symptom exacerbations in the large subpopulation of
      injury survivors who already carry a substantial pre-injury burden of multiple chronic
      medical conditions.

      Pain is one of the most burdensome symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, and
      opioids are the cornerstone of clinical pain management in cancer patients. Yet, individual
      patient responses to opioids vary widely, and the patient's genotype contributes to this
      variability. Specifically, cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype has important relevance for
      response to opioid analgesics that depend on CYP2D6 for bioactivation. Poor metabolizers
      (PMs) have lower concentrations of active metabolites of codeine (morphine), tramadol
      (O-desmethyltramadol), oxycodone (oxymorphone), and hydrocodone (hydromorphone), compared to
      extensive metabolizers (EMs). Morphine and O-desmethyltramadol have 200-fold greater affinity
      for the -opioid receptor than the parent compound, whereas oxymorphone and hydromorphone
      have 40-fold and 10-fold higher receptor affinity compared to their parent compounds,
      respectively. Consequently, PMs may fail to derive pain relief from these opioids compared to
      EMs. Interestingly, the occurrence of side effects may not differ between PMs and EMs so that
      while PMs may get little to no pain relief from certain opioid analgesics, they may still
      experience troublesome adverse effects. Intermediate metabolizers (IMs) are also expected to
      have reduced analgesic response based on their significant reduction in enzyme activity.
      Conversely, individuals with the UM phenotype may have toxic concentrations of active opioid
      metabolites, with reports of life-threatening toxicity and death. The -opioid receptor gene
      (OPRM1) is the primary binding site for endogenous opioid peptides and opioid analgesics, and
      may have additional contributions to opioid response. The investigators propose to examine
      the effect of CYP2D6 genotype-guided pain management on cancer pain control in study
      participants and the additional effect of the OPRM1 genotype on response to opioids.

      Back pain is a huge problem for millions of Americans, including nearly 11 million Veterans.
      Our older Veterans suffer the most. Citizens spend billions of dollars, yet consistently get
      poor results. Primary Care Providers are often tasked with diagnosing and treating Chronic
      Low Back Pain, even though they are often undereducated in the field. These PCPs often use
      advanced imaging, usually MRIs to guide care. These images often show degenerative disc
      disease and other common pathologies in older adults, even those who are pain free, which can
      lead to misdiagnosis and treatment. The investigators believe that Chronic Low Back Pain is a
      syndrome, a final common pathway for the expression of multiple contributors that often lie
      outside the spine itself. For example, hip osteoarthritis, knee pain, and even anxiety could
      all lessen back pain if addressed and treated probably.

      Investigators will measure participants' low back pain-associated disability with the
      well-validated RMDQ. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly via telephone. The
      investigators hypothesize that veterans who receive PCCET will experience significantly
      greater reduction in low back pain-associated disability than those who receive IAUC at six
      months.

      Investigators will also measure participants' low back pain with the 0-10 Numeric Rating
      Scale for Pain. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly via telephone. The
      investigators hypothesize that veterans who receive PCCET will experience significantly
      greater reduction in low back pain than those who receive IAUC at six months.

      The goal of this study is to compare patients treated with usual care, which usually starts
      with imaging, versus patients who are treated by trained geriatricians who know how to
      recognize and address 11 key conditions that commonly drive pain and disability in older
      adults. The investigators believe that older patients who receive care tailored to their
      needs by educated PCPs will ultimately have less back pain and, more importantly, better
      quality of life.

      feasibility and efficacy of this treatment and to elucidate the enteric microbiota in the
      middle-lower GI tract. Self-report measures and a laboratory task will be collected from
      children, ages 9-13 years of age, and self-report measures from their primary caregivers
      prior to and following a 30-day probiotic administration. Children who score above cutoff in
      anxiety and/or abdominal pain meet the inclusion criteria for this study. Because of limited
      sample size and the iterative nature of intervention development, criteria for success at the
      pilot phase are based primarily on clinical rather than statistical criteria. The study
      personnel will do their best to keep and ensure the privacy and confidentiality of our
      participants; however, some of the risks of this study may include psychological discomfort,
      legal risks, and loss of confidentially.

      Peripheral intravenous catheters (IVs) are utilized in the majority of hospitalized children.
      The placement of IVs requires significant staff time, contributes to health care costs, and
      causes pain and distress in the patients receiving them. Techniques currently used at
      Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) to reduce children's anxiety and increase success of
      IV placement center depends on members of the Child Life Department distracting patients
      during insertion. Recent literature has suggested that humanoid robots can be a powerful form
      of distraction and lead to decreased pain during painful procedures in children. Work done by
      the University of Southern California (USC) Interaction Lab has shown that socially assistive
      robots can use techniques more complex than pure distraction to lead to a human-robot
      interaction that is perceived as more positive by the human. The investigators propose a
      project pairing children receiving an IV with either a (1) Child Life staff member only (2)
      pure distraction robot + Child Life or (3) an robot teaching coping skills + Child Life with
      a goal of reduced pain. Pain will be measured by participant self-report, family member

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature wound of Veterans returning from the recent
      operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (i.e OIF/OEF/OND), with up to 20 percent experiencing
      persistent post-concussive symptoms. Among Veterans with mild TBI, the majority also
      experience significant distress, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, as
      well as persistent pain. Importantly, significant stigma is associated with seeking mental
      health care among Veterans; and poor management of multiple conditions results in increased
      morbidity and mortality, increased risk for suicide, and significantly decreased quality of
      life. Thus the challenge for treatment providers is to provide a unified and acceptable
      intervention for Veterans with these interdependent systemic comorbid concerns. The aim of
      this proposal is to develop, refine, and evaluate a 1-day trans-diagnostic (i.e., applies to
      more than one diagnosis) ""life skills workshop"" to help Veterans develop skills needed to
      pursue valued goals in the face of life's challenges.

      Morphine is the opioid used to treat pain after surgery. Acetaminophen (called APAP) can
      reduce the amount of opioids needed for this.

      The problem is that morphine slows down digestion. That can delay pain relief from APAP
      pills. It can even change what the body does to the drug [pharmacokinetics (PK)].

      Some doctors have started using intravenous (IV) APAP with morphine, instead of the pills.

      This study will measure the PK of APAP pills and IV when used with morphine in healthy

      This research study is testing whether the local anesthetic lidocaine is as effective as
      ropivacaine for post-operative pain control in continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve
      blocks. Ropivacaine and Lidocaine are FDA-approved drugs that has been successfully used in
      this hospital for post-operative pain control for the past few years, thus has become the
      standard drugs used for this nerve block. Lidocaine has numerous potential advantages over
      ropivacaine, such as faster onset of action, better safety profile and greater
      anti-inflammatory action. Catheters placed near both sides of a patient's spine for
      postoperative pain control are called thoracic paravertebral nerve blocks and are a part of
      routine care. Through those catheters, a ""numbing"" medication, or local anesthetic, to block
      the transmission of pain from the surgical incision to the spinal cord, thus reducing pain.
      The research part of the study is whether subjects will receive either the local anesthetic
      lidocaine or ropivacaine. The goal of this study is to determine whether the lidocaine
      controls pain better and facilitates a faster recovery after abdominal surgery than
      ropivacaine.

      In this research study, the investigators will compare patient-reported pain scores, any
      additional pain medication requirements for adequate pain control, time it takes for bowel

      versus those receiving ropivacaine. The investigators will screen 100 patients and enroll 60

      Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is considered to be a major surgical procedure resulting in
      severe postoperative pain, especially in the first 48 hours after surgery. The use of

      Pain after surgery is unavoidable, and opioid medications are the cornerstone of most pain
      management regimens. However, they come at a cost with profound impacts on gastrointestinal
      motility, respiratory depression, and even long-term dependence. Stimulating the external ear
      with cutaneous electrical current is similar to acupuncture and could help improve
      postoperative pain. The Bridge device (manufactured by Key Electronics [Jeffersonville, IN,
      USA] and distributed by Innovative Health Solutions [Versailles, IN, USA]), has been used
      with success in treating opioid withdrawal and in animal studies has shown increases in pain
      thresholds. The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded trial to evaluate if auricular neurostimulation improves postoperative pain
      and reduces opioid requirements for patients undergoing elective colon surgery.

      pain perception in post-operative patients may be modulated via the auricular branch of the
      vagus nerve. This has the potential to reduce the use of opioid medications, which will in
      turn reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus and reduce patient need for and dependence
      on narcotic pain medications. This would have an enormous economic impact due to decreased
      length of hospital stays for patients who undergo abdominal surgery. In addition, opioid
      reduction could potentially lessen the national crisis of opioid addiction.

      The moderate-to-severe pain many patients experience following orthopedic surgery is often
      treated with opioids, which are associated with side effects such as nausea/vomiting,
      sedation, and respiratory depression (and a risk of abuse). Potent site-specific analgesia
      with fewer side effects may be provided with a ""continuous peripheral nerve block,"" which
      involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter adjacent to the peripheral nerve(s)
      supplying a surgical site. Local anesthetic is introduced via the catheter. However, there
      are major problems with continuous nerve blocks that have dramatically limited their use
      outside academic centers. Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) or ""nerve
      modulation"" is an alternative method of pain control involving the insertion of an electrical
      lead through an introducing needle-obviating an open surgical incision for placement-followed
      by the introduction of electric current to produce analgesia. This modality has been used to
      treat chronic pain, but it has not been evaluated with a randomized, controlled study when
      applied to acute pain management (post-surgical analgesia). This temporary therapy has
      multiple theoretical benefits over existing analgesics, such as a lack of systemic side
      effects (e.g., nausea, respiratory depression), an absence of induced muscle weakness, and a
      reduced risk of adverse events (e.g. infection). The purpose of the proposed randomized,
      double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover, feasibility study is to explore the possibility
      of treating postoperative pain with ultrasound-guided percutaneous PNS and, if so, to help
      power a subsequent definitive randomized, controlled trial.

      Twenty-eight percent of Americans over the age of 65 die in a nursing home. Research has
      found the quality of care of end-of-life care in nursing homes to have many challenges. It
      has also been documented that family members, especially those living at a distance, want to
      be involved in the care of their resident and family support can be beneficial to residents.
      Family members' involvement in decision-making in the nursing home setting improves outcomes
      for residents with life-limiting illnesses. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process wherein
      a healthcare choice is jointly made by a healthcare provider and a resident or resident's
      proxy, often a family member. This proposal seeks to facilitate SDM among family members,
      residents with life-limiting illnesses (who are not enrolled in hospice), and the nursing
      home care team. The overall research question (RQ) asks: To what extent are outcomes for
      family member and residents with life limiting illnesses associated with SDM via
      web-conferencing in the nursing home? The overall hypothesis (H) is that SDM among family
      members, residents (when possible), and skilled nursing home staff via web-conferencing will
      improve outcomes for family members and residents with life-limiting illnesses. This is an
      exploratory mixed methods randomized clinical trial pilot to test the effect of shared
      decision making using web-based conferencing on the depression and burden of family members
      and the pain of nursing home residents.

      Chronic pain incurs over half a trillion dollars in lost productivity (healthcare, lost
      wages, etc) annually. The most common source is low back pain (LBP), often from facet joints.
      The clinical evaluation of facet joints is challenging and anatomic imaging findings of facet
      joint; degenerative change; correlate poorly with pain. Therefore, it is difficult to select
      appropriate candidate patients/facet joints to treat. Misguided percutaneous treatment can
      cost thousands of dollars per session and delay diagnoses. Very limited retrospective
      information suggests that high grade peri-facet MRI signal change correlates to the side of
      LBP. However, this has not fully characterized the imaging findings and has not correlated to
      expert clinical exam/percutaneous response, precluding robust and meaningful clinical impact.
      Minimal retrospective data concludes inflammatory changes can be identified on FDG-PET exams,
      but the evidence of correlation to patient pain is lacking. Limited DWI exists for
      inflammatory spondyloarthropathies and myopathies, but is also lacking.

      This is an exploratory study investigating the utility of FDG PET activity and MRI signal
      change around facet joints in the clinical management of low back pain. This study will help
      determine if such imaging biomarkers could change clinical management. Additionally, this
      will provide data that will be vital to planning a larger prospective study evaluating the
      ability of imaging biomarkers to predict response to comparison medial branch blocks and RF
      ablation for treatment of facet joint pain.

      Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over
      prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean
      delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given
      opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other
      developed countries. We believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is superior to
      current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a decrease in
      the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients' recovery and
      bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden of opioid
      abuse in the US. Our objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain regimen in
      pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled
      trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen
      (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin incision, and a dose of IM
      ketorolac at time of fascial closure. These study medications are currently used in our
      patient population but not in a standardized fashion, not in every patient, and not always in
      combination with each other. The control group will receive placebo IV infusion
      preoperatively and an IM injection at fascial closure, and subcutaneous infiltration with
      normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive spinal regional anesthesia as
      per anesthesia team and then postoperatively, both groups will receive the current standard
      of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed
      depending on pain score. Our primary outcome of interest will be the total opioid intake in
      the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to first opioid given, pain
      scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of opioid tablets left after
      discharge on post op day number 7. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction scores and
      total length of hospital stay. We will evaluate neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores,
      cord blood gases, immediate newborn complications in the first 48 hours after birth, and any
      infant adverse outcomes related to maternal opioid use up to 4 weeks of life. Our hypothesis
      is that our multimodal pain regimen will decrease the total opioid requirement in the first
      48 hours after surgery.

      Patient satisfaction with healthcare is increasingly being utilized as a metric to reflect
      provider and hospital quality of care. Furthermore, at the core of a healthcare team and
      healthcare system is the desire to provide patients with the best possible care in order to
      achieve the best possible outcomes. Providers have the duty to identify areas of needed
      improvement within the domains of treatment. An area of need that is ubiquitous within
      medicine is pain control; in this case acute postoperative pain control is the targeted
      condition. Studies have already shown that better control of acute postoperative pain leads
      to shortened hospital stays, reduced hospital costs and patient morbidity, improved patient
      satisfaction and a reduced likelihood of developing chronic pain. Research within the field
      of pain management has definitively revealed that a combination of different medication
      regimens can control acute postoperative pain better than narcotics alone. In particular, the
      medication gabapentin has been shown to improve acute postop pain in many kinds of surgical
      settings, and it is a safe medication with arguably fewer side effects than narcotics. The
      investigators know that certain groups of post surgical otolaryngology patients can be at
      risk for high levels of postoperative pain. Given all of this information, physicians have a
      responsibility to utilize medications such as gabapentin to do a better job of controlling
      patient's pain. This investigation is a quality improvement project designed to elucidate the
      benefits of gabapentin in pain management in patients undergoing surgery of the head and neck
      mucosal surfaces. It will provide much needed data in an understudied population and
      ultimately will improve the practice of pain management, patient satisfaction and quality of
      care delivered in the Barnes otolaryngology department.

      Nearly 2 out of 10 women will sustain a distal forearm fracture throughout their
      lifespan.Recent longitudinal studies illustrate that as many as 1/3 of all persons who
      undergo closed reduction and casting for distal radius fractures (DRF) go on to develop type
      1 complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Graded motor imagery (i.e., motor imagery and mirror
      therapy), a movement representation technique, is strongly supported in the literature as a
      treatment of CRPS and has recently been suggested as a potential strategy to prevent its

      Despite the increasing use of patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) for postoperative pain
      management, efforts are continuing to find effective methods to relieve pain after abdominal
      surgery. Although opioid is an effective analgesic it has opioid related adverse events
      (ORAEs). Bupivacaine should reduce postoperative pain but it has relatively shorter duration
      of action. Liposome bupivacaine (Exparel) has been approved as a single dose infiltration for
      longer postoperative period analgesic. It provides up to 72 hours analgesia postoperatively;

      Nausea is a common complaint in patients who present to the emergency department (ED).
      Although the number of conditions that can present with nausea are numerous, the mainstay of
      treatment has become intravenous ondansetron (Zofran), not only due to its rapid onset but
      also its availability. One of the major drawbacks to using this form is that it often needs
      to be redosed. This study aims to compare intravenous (IV) ondansetron alone versus IV
      ondansetron given with IV dexamethasone (Decadron) as another viable option when treating
      patients with nausea in the emergency department.

      Previous studies in patients undergoing surgical procedures have shown that when IV
      dexamethasone is given with IV ondansetron to post-operative patients they have less nausea
      and vomiting than ondansetron alone, and were even found to show decreased post-operative
      pain associated with nausea. It has also been shown to decrease the need to re-dose
      antiemetic medication. Although this combination has not been tested in the emergency
      department it is believed by these investigators that the additional use of dexamethasone may
      decrease the need to use repeated doses of ondansetron.

      The investigators believe this may change the way physicians currently approach the nauseated
      patient in regards to treatment. That rather than possibly giving multiple doses of one
      medication over and over to reduce a patient's nausea, physicians can give two medications
      together at one time. The investigators hope to demonstrate that by giving intravenous
      dexamethasone and ondansetron together, it may be possible to reduce the number of patients
      who need additional doses of nausea medication.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in patient outcomes with
      general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia when given in addition to popliteal and adductor
      canal nerve blocks for foot and ankle surgery. Popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks are
      injections of local anesthetic agents near nerves in the back and front of the knee going to
      the foot and ankle that provide numbness during and after surgery. These peripheral nerve
      blocks offer good pain control and reduce the need for opioids (opioids are pain medications
      such as morphine, Dilaudid, and oxycodone). General anesthesia involves the flow of oxygen
      and anesthesia gas through a tube which, along with additional intravenous medications,
      causes unconsciousness and unawareness of sensations during surgery. Spinal anesthesia
      involves an injection of local anesthetic in the lower back, which causes numbness below the
      waist. In addition to spinal anesthesia, a sedative is typically given intravenously to cause
      relaxation and sleepiness throughout surgery.

      General, spinal, and nerve block anesthesia are all routinely used for surgery at the
      Hospital for Special Surgery. General or spinal anesthesia is typically used in addition to
      peripheral nerve blocks during foot and ankle surgery to 1) allow the surgeons to use a thigh
      tourniquet to reduce bleeding, 2) provide anesthesia earlier, and 3) prevent unwanted
      movement. However, it is unclear whether general or spinal anesthesia provides better patient
      outcomes when given with peripheral nerve blocks. Some reports show that on its own, spinal
      anesthesia has advantages over general anesthesia in terms of side effects such as nausea and
      pain. However, these advantages may also be gained from combining peripheral nerve blocks
      with general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia can be associated with headache and backache,
      although headache and backache can also happen after operations performed with general
      anesthesia. A previous study at the Hospital for Special Surgery showed low rates of nausea
      among patients who received nerve blocks with spinal anesthesia, and no nausea among patients
      who received a nerve block with general anesthesia. Therefore, the primary aim of this study
      is to determine if, as a treatment, either general or spinal anesthesia has advantages over
      the other treatment in terms of readiness for discharge, side effects, pain and patient
      satisfaction in an ambulatory foot and ankle population.

      To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n = 40) of hatha yoga vs. a health education
      group (attention control) for persons with chronic pain who are taking methadone maintenance
      therapy (MMT) or bupreonorphine (BUP) for opioid use disorder maintenance treatment.
      Participants will be enrolled in the active intervention for 3 months, and then be followed
      for 6 months afterwards. Investigators' aims are:

        1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of both the yoga class and the health education
           control group. Investigators will assess credibility of the assigned intervention and
           expectancy for improvement for both groups at baseline, program satisfaction following
           program participation, participant adherence (class attendance rate and amount of home
           practice corresponding to assigned study arm), and instructor fidelity to the manuals.
           Investigators will conduct structured interviews following program participation to
           understand specific aspects of both programs considered attractive, useful, or not
           useful; we will solicit suggestions for improvements as well.

        2. To assess safety, investigators will track all adverse events in a structured fashion.
           Investigators do not expect to see any serious adverse events definitely or probably
           related to study participation.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial in which patients that are scheduled to
      undergo a laparoscopic hysterectomy would be allocated to one of two groups: Paracervical
      block with local anesthetic (bupivacaine 0.5%), or placebo. This would be achieved using
      block randomization. The intervention would be performed after the patient is under general
      anesthesia, prior to starting the surgery. Patients would be consented in the office or
      preoperative area (before receiving sedatives). As far as the intervention itself, it would
      consist of injecting 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine into the cervical stroma at 3 and 9 o'clock,
      which is standard technique for para-cervical block. The remainder of the procedure will then
      continue in a regular fashion. Alternatively, patients in the control group will be injected
      with 5 mL of normal saline. The surgeon would be blinded as to patient allocation. Research
      staff will have previously prepared the formulations (saline or bupivacaine) and have sent
      them to the operating room prior to beginning the procedure depending on assigned group. At
      the end of the case, pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale with a range from 0
      to 10 by one of the researches who will also be blinded to the group. This will be done at 30
      and 60 minutes after surgical stop time. Additional pain control in the postanesthesia care

      registry with the above data for use in quality improvement research. The investigators will
      engage patients, providers and investigators in designing PTSM, reviewing prototypes, and
      conducting usability testing. In a 6-month clinical trial, the investigators will compare 50

      Intranasal (IN) midazolam is an anxiolytic that is commonly used in the pediatric population
      for procedural anxiolysis in the emergency department (ED) setting to facilitate painful and
      distressing procedures, such as laceration repairs. Intranasal midazolam is both effective
      and safe in children. However, due to the acidic nature of midazolam, there is a burning
      sensation that is associated with the intranasal administration of midazolam. The use of IN
      lidocaine has been shown to decrease the pain associated with the administration of IN
      midazolam and other acidic solutions. The IN lidocaine can be given as a premedication
      (PREMED), where it is sprayed in the nares first to provide topical anesthesia, and then
      followed by the administration of the IN midazolam. Lidocaine can also be given concurrently
      with the IN midazolam (PREMIX), where it is mixed with the midazolam and then the combined
      mixture administered. Both methods have been shown to be effective in decreasing the pain
      associated with the intranasal administration of acidic solutions, such as midazolam,
      although the PREMIX method could have the advantage of requiring less number of sprays, and
      be tolerated better by children. Although both methods have been shown to work, it is not
      known if the PREMIX method is non-inferior to the PREMED method for decreasing pain and
      distress associated with administering IN midazolam. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      determine if the PREMIX method is non-inferior to the PREMED method of using lidocaine to
      decrease the pain and distress associated with the administration of IN midazolam in
      children.

      Women having abortion procedures between 15 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days gestational age
      on the day of their procedure commonly have dilators placed in their cervix overnight before
      the abortion procedure. The dilators are put in during a pelvic exam in the clinic and after
      women go home they expand slowly overnight to open the cervix before the abortion procedure
      the next day. This can be a painful experience and health care providers often give women
      different kinds of pain medicine to help them.

      The investigators are interested in whether a medicine called gabapentin, which is a
      non-narcotic medicine, could help. Gabapentin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for prevention of seizures and for treating nerve pain and doctors are
      also using it to decrease pain for people having surgical procedures.

      The main goals of our study are to learn about:

        1. Women's pain experience with dilators in their cervix overnight before the abortion
           procedure

        2. How well gabapentin works to decrease women's pain while they have the dilators in their
           cervix

      Women who enroll in the study will get a dose of either gabapentin or placebo (a pill with no
      medicine in it) before their dilators are placed in the clinic. The medication they get
      (gabapentin or placebo) will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the women in
      the study nor the doctors giving them the medication will know which medication they receive
      so the investigators can learn about their pain without being influenced by knowing which
      medication they take. Doctors will be able to find out which medication women got if there is
      an emergency or if it changes their medical care.

      The investigators will communicate with women in real time overnight by text messaging to see
      how much pain they are having in the moment and how much pain medicine they are taking.

      The investigators hypothesize that women who receive gabapentin will have a smaller increase
      in their pain with the dilators than women who receive placebo (a pill with no medicine in
      it).

      The investigators' findings will help doctors understand women's pain experience with
      dilators better and possibly provide a new way of treating pain with gabapentin.

      For pain relief during a first trimester surgical aspiration, most providers use the
      paracervical block, either alone or in combination with other pain control techniques. Some

      lidocaine. At our clinics, the standard pain management protocol is using 20 cc of 1% plain
      lidocaine in a two site injection. Few studies have compared buffered versus unbuffered

      The post-thoracotomy pain (PTP) has been defined as persistent or recurrent pain that lasts
      for at least 2 month after thoracotomy and is associated with surgical incision or its
      intercostal nerve cutaneous distribution. The latter has a prevalence of about 15% to 20%. In
      about 80% of the patients such pain is moderate to severe in intensity and is associated with
      depression and insomnia. According to its characteristics and possible etiology, PTP is part
      of the neuropathic pain syndromes. Patients describe their chest wall pain as shooting,
      burning and numbness which are descriptors often seen in other neuropathic pain syndromes.
      PTP occurs most likely after partial or complete intercostal nerve damage secondary
      mechanical trauma (nerve traction or compression) during surgery. The concern is that when
      robotic surgery for minimally invasive approach to the heart valves or vessels such
      compression and consequent damage may happen to intercostal nerves.

      Therapeutic use for a lidocaine patch include post-herpetic neuralgia postthoracotomy pain,
      stump neuroma pain, intercostal neuralgia, diabetic polyneuropathy, meralgia paresthetica,
      complex regional pain syndrome, radiculopathy, postmastectomy pain and some other focal
      peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes. It is an effective and safe topical treatment. Its
      efficacy demonstrated previously in treatment of intercostal neuralgia and some patients with
      post-thoracotomy syndrome can be used in treatment of perioperative chest pain related to
      robotic cardiac surgery. Hypothesis is that the use of topical lidocaine will decrease pain
      in acute phase after the surgery and decrease intensity of post-thoracotomy pain 6 months
      after such procedure.

      The effect of topical 5% lidocaine will be clinically evaluated through prospective,
      randomized, placebo, double-blind study. Each patient will be assessed at admission and then,
      one week after Valve Replacement (Recommended surgical procedures do not included harvesting
      of leg vessels as this could be a potential confounder). Then, one month, three and six month
      follow-up for all patients by mailing questionnaires and phone calls.

      Upon admission, as well as 1 week, 1month, 3months and 6 months following surgical procedure,
      the following tests will be performed:

        -  Pain Disability Index (PDI)

        -  DASS

        -  VAS Pain Score

      Chronic pain is a severe disabling problem within society, affecting 25-30% of the United
      States population.. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has the potential to
      provide a treatment option that is safe, scientifically-supported, low-cost, and
      easy-to-administer method to effectively reduce symptoms in patients suffering from chronic
      pain. The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using tACS to treat patients
      with chronic pain, and to collect pilot efficacy as well as EEG and EKG biomarker data for
      optimizing the design of subsequent large-scale studies. The treatment rationale is to

      The primary objectives of this pilot trial are to evaluate the feasibility, safety and
      acceptability of an integrative care pathway that includes chiropractic care, for the
      coordinated care for Veterans Administration (VA) patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP),
      with an emphasis on those with mental health comorbidity, in preparation for the conduct of
      an appropriately powered multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT). The secondary
      objectives are to collect study outcomes at the baseline visit (BV) and at weeks 3, 5, 7, and
      10 to: 1) assess the success of collecting outcomes; 2) determine the outcome measures to use
      in a future RCT; and 3) determine preliminary intervention effect sizes and variability to
      aid in sample size determination for a future RCT. The investigators hypothesize that
      chiropractic care offers relief for pain and mental health symptoms through the direct
      effects of treatment-focused CMT, as well as through the indirect, non-specific effects of
      the team-based relationship with the clinician.

      This pilot study is a single-arm trial. All participants will be asked to complete study
      outcomes which include the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), LBP intensity and
      interference as measured by the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), as well as
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale
      (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder

      General Activity Assessment Tool (PEG) questionnaires, and the Pain Assessment Screening Tool
      and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) assessment, which includes measures of pain, disability,
      mental health, quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction. All participants will receive up
      to 10 weeks of chiropractic care and will complete outcome assessments at weeks 3, 5, 7, and
      10 of the study.

      Epidurals are an effective means for providing neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia. Prior
      studies in labor epidurals have demonstrated that a programmed intermittent bolus application
      of local anesthesia can improve pain control by reducing the amount of local anesthetic
      required as well as improve patient satisfaction when compared to continuous epidural
      infusions. The effects of programmed intermittent bolus of epidural local anesthetics
      compared to continuous epidural infusions in a surgical setting have yet to be elucidated.
      Our goal is to evaluate the use of programmed intermittent bolus compared to continuous
      epidural infusion in a surgical patient population. We plan to enroll patients already
      undergoing abdominal surgeries including colorectal, gynecologic, surgical oncology,
      urological where epidural anesthesia can be employed. The primary endpoints of the study will
      be the total local anesthetic consumption and total opioid consumption as surrogate markers
      for the quality of epidural anesthesia. Secondary endpoints are pain scores and functional
      measurements, patient satisfaction, and incidence of hypotension.

      The current way that pain is treated after trauma and injury is problematic. Most often pain
      after trauma is treated with opioids (ex. Percocet or Vicodin) or anti-inflammatories (ex.
      ibuprofen). Both of these medications can cause side effects and opioids have been related to
      the development of addiction. In addition, there are not any treatments that prevent pain
      from going on to become persistent (last beyond it is supposed to) or chronic (lasting 3
      months or longer).

      Chronic pain is an enormous problem and there an urgent need to find both alternatives to
      opioid pain medications and medications that prevent pain from becoming chronic. The
      ATTAC-Pain (Altering The Transition from Acute to Chronic Pain) study proposes to examine
      whether duloxetine (a medication that is marketed for depression, anxiety, and specific types
      of pain conditions), can reduce acute and chronic pain among adults who come to the emergency
      department (ED)with muscular pain (such as neck pain after a car accident or low back pain).
      Investigators will enroll 60 patients who come to the ED. Patients will be eligible if they
      report moderate to severe muscular pain (such as pain in the back, neck, or shoulders).
      Consenting patients will be randomized to receive duloxetine 30mg, duloxetine 60mg, or
      placebo (2/3rd chance of being in one of the duloxetine groups). The study team will follow
      patients for six weeks and collect information on pain outcomes and use of pain medications.
      Investigators aim to determine if duloxetine can (1) reduce acute pain symptoms following the
      ED visit, (2) prevent the transition to persistent pain (having pain 6 weeks after the
      initial ED visit), and (3) decrease opioid use following a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The
      results of this study will ultimately help determine if duloxetine can be used as a
      non-opioid pain treatment option that reduces acute pain and prevents the transition to
      chronic pain. This in turn can improve recovery, reduce opioid use and its consequences, and
      decrease health care costs.

      Approximately 5-8% of children report severe chronic pain and disability. Although evidence
      supports pain-self management as effective for reducing pain and disability, data show that
      most youth do not have access to this intervention. The investigative team's prior studies
      demonstrate that technology-delivered pain self-management (WebMAP program) can reduce
      barriers to care, is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing pain-related disability
      and improving anxiety and depression in youth with chronic pain. In this trial, the
      investigators propose an implementation project to address critical challenges in nationwide
      dissemination of the WebMAP pain self-management program. Using a hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation trial design, 8 clinics from across the U.S. will participate in
      a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design to sequentially implement
      WebMAP in the clinics following randomized usual care periods. Data will be collected from
      clinic records, web and app administrative tracking, and provider surveys to gather
      information on adoption and implementation following the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) public health impact framework. Individual patient-level
      pain outcomes will be collected from 140 patients to evaluate intervention effectiveness. The
      expected outcome of the project is to yield a strategic approach for a nationwide
      technology-delivered pain self-management intervention for youth with chronic pain that can
      be readily sustained in clinical settings.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if giving an injection of numbing medication at the
      incision at the end of cesarean will help control pain AFTER cesarean delivery. This study
      seeks to assess pain relief with incisional infiltration of local anesthetic during cesareans
      performed under spinal anesthesia also using intrathecal opioids. Participants will receive
      the usual regimen of pain medication in spinal anesthesia. At the end of the cesarean
      delivery, while the participants are still under the spinal medication, participants will
      receive an injection, at the incision, either numbing medication (with or without
      epinephrine) or sterile saline. After the cesarean delivery, participants will receive, by
      mouth, commonly prescribed pain medications - these medications are oxycodone (an opioid/
      narcotic), acetaminophen (or more commonly known as Tylenol), and ibuprofen.

      The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at Vanderbilt is a multidisciplinary
      outpatient clinic treating patients with chronic pain and complex health issues via
      integrative services, with goals of improving overall health and wellbeing of those served.
      At OCIM, clinical hypnosis has been historically provided on an individual basis by the
      investigator. Due to its impact and increased patient demand for this service, the
      investigator will be conducting group hypnosis services in addition to individual services
      order to expand the reach of this program to participants. As such, the investigators see
      this as a tremendous opportunity to contribute to clinical research to contribute to the
      evidence based for this form of service by examining participant-reported outcomes associated
      with completing the treatment. For this project, the investigators seek to assess the impact
      of a manualized group treatment protocol utilizing clinical hypnosis as a treatment for
      chronic pain. The investigators will be evaluating participant-reported outcomes to assess
      the feasibility of conducting hypnosis in this setting, impact of group hypnosis on pain and
      how participants' responsiveness to hypnosis impacts treatment outcome.

      Purpose:

      To evaluate the preventative effects of pregabalin on pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain in
      cycle 1. Because granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors are found at nerve
      endings which modulate the pain signal, blocking this with pregabalin is theorized to prevent
      the occurrence of this adverse effect.

      Participants:

      Patients will be at least 18 years of age with either a diagnosis of a non-myeloid
      hematologic malignancy scheduled to initiate a cycle of chemotherapy that requires
      prophylactic use of a G-CSF, or with a diagnosis of breast cancer scheduled to initiate
      dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy or docetaxel/cyclophosphamide that
      requires prophylactic use of a G-CSF.

      Procedures (methods):

      This is a randomized (1:1), single center, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover phase
      II study. The primary objective is to compare the proportion of patients who have an increase
      in pain score of 3 from baseline in cycle 1 between Arm A (pregabalin) and Arm B (placebo).
      In consultation with the treating physician, the PI will determine what day pegfilgrastim
      will be initiated in each eligible, consented patient. Pregabalin or placebo will begin 4
      days prior to pegfilgrastim administration, and continue for 7 additional days starting the
      day of pegfilgrastim administration.

      This study, sponsored by Nihon Kohden, aims to determine the sensitivity and specificity of
      synthesized 18-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in the diagnosis of posterior-lateral and/or
      right-ventricular ischemia, using actual 18-lead ECG as the gold standard. The synthesized
      18-lead ECG calculates six extra leads of information from the standard 12-lead ECG done in
      the Emergency Department (ED). Nihon Kohden has created synECi18 Technology, which can
      mathematically synthesize and display the extra leads.

      The patient population (n=300) will consist of patients who present to the North Shore
      University Hospital or Long Island Jewish Medical Center ED with a chief complaint of chest
      pain, chest pressure, or chest discomfort. These patients will be receiving a standard
      12-lead ECG as part of their routine clinical care. Patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (STEMI) and a known positive troponin value will be excluded from the study.

      Trained ED study technicians will use ECG machines provided by Nihon Kohden to obtain two
      consecutive 15-lead ECGs. The two 15-lead ECGs are then saved onto the ECG machine.The saved
      information will later be input into an algorithm to calculate the synthesized 18-leads. The
      actual 18-leads (composed of the two 15-leads conducted in the ED) will be compared with the
      synthesized 18-leads produced by the synECi18 technology. A study cardiologists will evaluate
      the actual 18-lead ECGs and synthesized 18-lead ECGs and determine whether there is
      posterior-lateral and/or right-sided ventricular ischemia. The cardiologists will be blinded
      to the type of waveform they are analyzing (synthesized versus actual).

      The study will not interfere with patient care or treatment, however, the two 15-lead ECGs
      done in the ED will be shown to the physician who can determine whether or not to order an
      official 18-lead ECG in the hospital's electronic medical record system.

      It is hypothesized that the synECi18 synthesized 18-lead ECGs will provide high sensitivity
      and specificity for diagnosing posterior-lateral and/or right-ventricular ischemia, with the
      actual 18-lead ECGs being used as the reference for comparison.

      Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for
      management of mild -to moderate pain in the ED (acute musculo-skeletal pain, headache, dental
      pain). Ibuprofen as a representative of NSAID's as a class follows the analgesic ceiling
      concept that postulates that there is a dose of a drug beyond which any further dosage
      increase results in no additional analgesic effect. Despite this fact, Ibuprofen may commonly
      be used at doses above its analgesic ceiling, although this may not offer an incremental
      analgesic advantage and potentially adds risk of harm. The analgesic ceiling dose for
      ibuprofen is only 200-400mg/dose, and about 1200 mg/day. Thus, we hypothesize that
      administration of Ibuprofen in a dose of 400 mg in the ED is as effective in treating
      mild-to-moderate acute pain in patients presenting to the ED as 600 mg and 800 mg

      Vulvodynia is a common condition in women (16%); however, at this time there is no known
      effective non-pharmacological therapy reported. Acupuncture is one complementary and
      alternative medicine therapy used by many patients with vulvodynia; some case reports show
      that acupuncture may be an effective intervention. In recent years, there were some studies
      registered took at like at actual trials of acupuncture on vulvodynia, but either they did
      not reach the trial aims, some studies did not get enough patients or the trial designs mimic
      drug studies and did not reflect acupuncture real characteristics.

      This study evaluates acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia; specifically, if it reduces
      vulvar pain, pain duration and pain with intercourse. It also examines how long the effect of
      acupuncture lasts in women with vulvodynia. One third of the women will receive acupuncture
      focused on pudendal nerve distribution area; another one third of the women will receive
      acupuncture focused on traditional meridian points; the other one third of women will use
      standard care (without acupuncture). Women who get a reduction in pain (included in
      subjective and objective scores) will have their pain monitored once a week for up to 6 weeks
      to see if the acupuncture effect lasts.

      mindfulness training program for adults with chronic pain (noncancer related). The
      intervention is based on the MIndfulness-based Stress Reduction Program, an 8-week
      mindfulness training program developed to help people manage stress-related and chronic
      conditions. The adapted mindfulness intervention will consist of four, weekly 1 hour and 30
      minute group sessions that are modified from the original program to fit the shorter length
      and to directly address chronic pain management. Participants will complete pre- and
      post-intervention surveys and daily mindfulness practice diaries, all online. The surveys
      will help us determine if participants experience decreased pain interference, increased
      quality-of-life, and increased psychological well-being over the course of the intervention.
      Participants will also complete a post-intervention telephone interview to help determine
      satisfaction with the intervention and areas where the intervention can be improved.

      Local anesthesia is an integral part of clinical pediatric dental practice, but it has
      challenges. It can be uncomfortable for children, and the risk of adverse events limits how
      much is used. Some evidence suggests benefits of buffering local anesthetics including equal
      effect with less pain on injection. These findings have not been replicated and validated
      among pediatric populations, creating a gap in the knowledge base. To address this knowledge
      gap and contribute to the evidence base on safety and efficacy of local anesthesia in
      pediatric dentistry, this investigation proposes to compare the anesthetic effects of
      buffered 1% lidocaine with those of unbuffered 2%, among children.

      The specific aims of this investigation are to determine differences between buffered 1% and
      unbuffered 2% lidocaine (both with 1:100,000 epinephrine) used for inferior alveolar nerve
      block (IAN) anesthesia, in the following domains:

        1. Pain experience on injection, time to onset following the administration, and time to
           recovery [subjective]

        2. Blood lidocaine levels 15 minutes following the administration and duration of pulpal
           anesthesia [objective]

      Null Hypotheses:

        1. No difference exists in anesthetic effectiveness for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral
           IAN block between buffered 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as compared to
           unbuffered 2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.

        2. No differences exist in peak blood lidocaine levels, pain on injection, time to lip
           numbness, and duration of anesthesia between the two drug formulations.

      Randomized subjects will be injected orally for bottom jaw anesthesia, with 3cc of buffered
      1% lidocaine (30mg) 1:100,000 epinephrine or 3cc unbuffered of 2% lidocaine (60mg) 1:100,000
      epinephrine. The injectable volume of the buffered formulation will include 0.3cc of 8.4%
      sodium bicarbonate.

      One faculty member in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at the University of North
      Carolina (UNC) School of Dentistry will administer the drugs in the Pediatric Dentistry
      clinic. The same clinician will administer injection to the same subjects at both visits.
      Clinicians and subjects will not know which drug formulation is given at which appointment.

      A clinician will measure the level of discomfort on injection, how long it takes for the lip
      to be numb, how long it takes for the first molar tooth in that area to be numb, how long it
      takes the local anesthetic to wear off, and how much of the anesthetic is in the blood.

      A large number of dentoalveolar (tooth extraction) procedures performed by Oral and
      Maxillofacial Surgeons utilize intravenous sedation. Procedures commonly performed may
      include surgical removal of teeth, bone grafting, surgical placement of dental implants, and
      removal of cysts or tumors from the jaws, among others. Obtaining peripheral intravevenous
      (IV) cannulation often proves to be a very stressful and anxious event for the patient. The
      anxiety and stress from the venipuncture alone affects not only the psychological stability
      of the patient, but also the patient's physiology. The Buzzy vibration external stimulation
      device has shown to be an effective tool in pediatric venipunture procedures. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the effects of the Buzzy stimulation device in pain and anxiety
      reduction during peripheral intravenous cannulation in an adult population.

      Enrollees in this study will be patients who will undergo dental surgery with intravenous
      sedation. The patients who are enrolled will receive an IV either with or without the Buzzy.
      The Buzzy is a small vibration device which will be placed next to the IV placement site.

      This is a prospective blinded, randomized controlled study. The study will include three
      study arms:

      Patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomies will be randomized to one of either
      ""Ultravision"" (study arm 1) or ""no Ultravision"" (study arm 2, i.e. the current standard of
      care) groups. The study will be conducted blinded to the investigator during the procedure
      through patient discharge. The Ultravision system will be present in both, with the generator
      covered (not seen by user) and either on or off depending on the randomization. 30 patients
      will be enrolled, 15 per group. Five patients undergoing myomectomy will have their
      procedures conducted using the Ultravision (study Arm 3).

      Ultravision is cleared for use in all laparoscopic surgery i.e. including laparoscopic
      hysterectomy and myomectomy, in the United States. However, the clinical benefits arising
      from its use in gynecology have not yet been quantitatively assessed and published in an
      independent medical journal.

      Study Purpose:

      There are three main study objectives

        1. To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision device during laparoscopic hysterectomy and
           myomectomy on the quality of visualization in the laparoscopic field

        2. To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision device during laparoscopic hysterectomy and

      The current opioid epidemic has led to a renewed interest in exploring non-pharmacological
      techniques to treat post-operative pain. An increasing number of patients are suffering from
      the adverse effects of opioid use following surgery, including post-operative nausea and
      vomiting, respiratory depression, immunosuppression, constipation, and most recently,
      addiction. In the United States, over $600 billion is spent every year on opioid addiction,
      including $79 billion related to opioid addiction following surgery. Despite many initiatives
      to decrease the use of opiates in the preoperative setting, opioids continue to be regularly
      prescribed before, during and after surgery. Although the risk of opioid addiction following
      surgery is recognized, the percentage of patients becoming addicted to opioids following
      surgery is not well understood. To date, there has been virtually no agreement regarding the
      duration and dosage that qualify for opioid dependence following surgery, nor that a clear
      estimation of the factors such as biological, psychosocial and socioeconomic that increase
      the risk of using opioids for extended periods of time after surgery. Therefore, in order to
      combat this growing health crisis at the ground level, it is incumbent upon the medical
      community to explore alternative methods of pain control to treat the surgical population in
      order to reduce the incidence of post-operative opioid addiction.

      Percutaneous Nerve Field Stimulation (PNFS) is one of these recognized methods that ongoing
      research has shown to be effective as a complementary method of pain management. While PNFS
      is not a novel concept, clinical indications of auricular field stimulation have been limited
      in the past due to requirement of bulky, stationary and non-disposable stimulators and
      electrodes. These technological limitations made it difficult to establish the real clinical
      potential of auricular stimulation for the perioperative management of pain in surgical
      patients, despite the demonstration that auriculotherapy has been shown to relieve pain in
      the postoperative setting.

      The NSS-2 BRIDGE is a battery operated and disposable percutaneous auricular nerve field
      stimulator (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA), that was recently cleared by
      the FDA and assigned a Class II Risk Designation; a class which includes surgical drapes,
      pumps and power wheelchairs. The indication for the NSS-2 BRIDGE is for the treatment of
      clinical symptoms related to opioid consumption and opioid withdrawal. These symptoms include
      abdominal pain, anxiety and post-operative nausea and vomiting; conditions which are also
      present following cesarean-section surgery. The use of the NSS-2 BRIDGE device has been
      demonstrated to provide significant analgesia in patients with abdominal pain syndrome, and
      clinical trials are ongoing to assess the benefit of this approach for post-operative pain
      management. As compared to the present use of opioids for perioperative pain management, the
      use of a complementary, non-pharmacologic approach offers the advantage of analgesia without
      the associated side effects.
